Yet today there is only one—homo sapiens. What happened to the others? And what may happen to us?Most books about the history of humanity pursue either a historical or a biological approach, but Dr. Yuval Noah Harari breaks the mold with this highly original book that begins about 70,000 years ago with the appearance of modern cognition. From examining the role evolving humans have played in the global ecosystem to charting the rise of empires, Sapiens integrates history and science to reconsider accepted narratives, connect past developments with contemporary concerns, and examine specific events within the context of larger ideas.Dr. Harari also compels us to look ahead, because over the last few decades humans have begun to bend laws of natural selection that have governed life for the past four billion years. We are acquiring the ability to design not only the world around us, but also ourselves. Where is this leading us, and what do we want to become?Featuring 27 photographs, 6 maps, and 25 illustrations/diagrams, this provocative and insightful work is sure to spark debate and is essential reading for aficionados of Jared Diamond, James Gleick, Matt Ridley, Robert Wright, and Sharon Moalem. ...more",from a renowned historian comes a groundbreaking narrative of humanity s creation and evolution a international bestseller that explores the ways in which biology and history have defined us and enhanced our understanding of what it means to be human one hundred thousand years ago at least six different species of humans inhabited earth yet today there is only one h from a renowned historian comes a groundbreaking narrative of humanity s creation and evolution a international bestseller that explores the ways in which biology and history have defined us and enhanced our understanding of what it means to be human one hundred thousand years ago at least six different species of humans inhabited earth yet today there is only one homo sapiens what happened to the others and what may happen to us most books about the history of humanity pursue either a historical or a biological approach but dr yuval noah harari breaks the mold with this highly original book that begins about years ago with the appearance of modern cognition from examining the role evolving humans have played in the global ecosystem to charting the rise of empires sapiens integrates history and science to reconsider accepted narratives connect past developments with contemporary concerns and examine specific events within the context of larger ideas dr harari also compels us to look ahead because over the last few decades humans have begun to bend laws of natural selection that have governed life for the past four billion years we are acquiring the ability to design not only the world around us but also ourselves where is this leading us and what do we want to become featuring photographs maps and illustrations diagrams this provocative and insightful work is sure to spark debate and is essential reading for aficionados of jared diamond james gleick matt ridley robert wright and sharon moalem more,BookNation

More than 140 years pre-Hillary, there was Victoria Woodhull. This book takes you back with a breathtaking, present-tense bird's eye view into a time when women's liberation was primarily confined to one woman's very capable, independent mind. I couldn't put it down.""---Ruth Buzzi, Golden Globe Award winner and Television Hall of Fame inductee""Sadly, too many Americans have never heard of Victoria Woodhull, let alone learned of her story: her revolutionary campaign for the presidency at a time when women weren't even allowed to vote, her support for worker's rights, or her feminist commitment to equality, a century before the official battle over the Equal Rights Amendment. But in The Coming Woman, Karen Hicks brings Woodhull's efforts to life, and reminds us that some of our nation's greatest figures aren't always featured in the history books. It is a riveting account of an amazing woman and her struggle for justice and human dignity, told in an engaging and eminently readable style.""-Tim Wise, author, ""White Like Me: Reflections on Race from a Privileged Son""""The Coming Woman"" is a novel based on the life of feminist Victoria Woodhull, the first woman to run for U.S. President, 50 years before women could even vote!Running for President wasn't Victoria's only first as a woman. She was also the first to own a successful Wall Street firm, the first to publish a successful national newspaper, and the first to head the two-million-member Spiritualist Association. She was the first woman to enter the Senate Judiciary Committee chambers to petition for woman's suffrage, her argument changing the entire focus of the suffragist movement by pointing out that the 14th and 15th Amendments already gave women the vote.In her campaign for the Presidency, Victoria Woodhull boldly addressed many of the issues we still face today: equal pay for equal work; freedom in love; corporate greed and political corruption fueled by powerful lobbyists; and the increasing disparity between the rich and the poor, to name only a few. Her outspoken and common-sense ideas may shed a new perspective on the parallel conundrums of today's world.This bold, beautiful, and sexually progressive woman dared to take on society and religion. To make an example of the hypocrisy in what Mark Twain dubbed The Gilded Age, she exposed the extramarital affairs of the most popular religious figure of the day (Henry Ward Beecher). This led to her persecution and imprisonment and the longest, most infamous trial of the 19th century. But it did not stop her fight for equality.Victoria's epic story, set in the late 1800s, comes to life in a modern, fictional style, while staying true to the actual words and views of the many well-known characters. ...more", if you have a heart if you have a soul karen hicks the coming woman will make you fall in love with victoria woodhull kinky friedman author and governor of the heart of texas what kind of confidence would it take for a woman to buck the old boy s club of politics in more than years pre hillary there was victoria woodhull this book takes you back with a if you have a heart if you have a soul karen hicks the coming woman will make you fall in love with victoria woodhull kinky friedman author and governor of the heart of texas what kind of confidence would it take for a woman to buck the old boy s club of politics in more than years pre hillary there was victoria woodhull this book takes you back with a breathtaking present tense bird s eye view into a time when women s liberation was primarily confined to one woman s very capable independent mind i couldn t put it down ruth buzzi golden globe award winner and television hall of fame inductee sadly too many americans have never heard of victoria woodhull let alone learned of her story her revolutionary campaign for the presidency at a time when women weren t even allowed to vote her support for worker s rights or her feminist commitment to equality a century before the official battle over the equal rights amendment but in the coming woman karen hicks brings woodhull s efforts to life and reminds us that some of our nation s greatest figures aren t always featured in the history books it is a riveting account of an amazing woman and her struggle for justice and human dignity told in an engaging and eminently readable style tim wise author white like me reflections on race from a privileged son the coming woman is a novel based on the life of feminist victoria woodhull the first woman to run for u s president years before women could even vote running for president wasn t victoria s only first as a woman she was also the first to own a successful wall street firm the first to publish a successful national newspaper and the first to head the two million member spiritualist association she was the first woman to enter the senate judiciary committee chambers to petition for woman s suffrage her argument changing the entire focus of the suffragist movement by pointing out that the th and th amendments already gave women the vote in her campaign for the presidency victoria woodhull boldly addressed many of the issues we still face today equal pay for equal work freedom in love corporate greed and political corruption fueled by powerful lobbyists and the increasing disparity between the rich and the poor to name only a few her outspoken and common sense ideas may shed a new perspective on the parallel conundrums of today s world this bold beautiful and sexually progressive woman dared to take on society and religion to make an example of the hypocrisy in what mark twain dubbed the gilded age she exposed the extramarital affairs of the most popular religious figure of the day henry ward beecher this led to her persecution and imprisonment and the longest most infamous trial of the th century but it did not stop her fight for equality victoria s epic story set in the late s comes to life in a modern fictional style while staying true to the actual words and views of the many well known characters more,Unknown

The sons of loggers, shipyard workers, and farmers, the boys defeated elite rivals first from eastern and British universities and finally the German crew rowing for Adolf Hitler in the Olympic games in Berlin, 1936. The emotional heart of the story lies with one rower, Joe Rantz, a teenager without family or prospects, who rows not for glory, but to regain his shattered self-regard and to find a place he can call home. The crew is assembled  by an enigmatic coach and mentored by a visionary, eccentric British boat builder, but it is their trust in each other that makes them a victorious team. They remind the country of what can be done when everyone quite literally pulls together—a perfect melding of commitment, determination, and optimism. Drawing on the boys’ own diaries and journals, their photos and memories of a once-in-a-lifetime shared dream, The Boys in the Boat is an irresistible story about beating the odds and finding hope in the most desperate of times—the improbable, intimate story of nine working-class boys from the American west who, in the depths of the Great Depression, showed the world what true grit really meant.

There is in her art the vulnerability of one who lives inside of the stories that she gathers in this remarkable collection. Her poems set off alarms even as they transform the world she inhabits, showing us, in the process, exactly what she asks of Romare Bearden’s art: ‘…how not to // assign all blackness near the sea / a captivity.’ This is one of the many sweet contradictions in the black maria, which ‘is a black flag / wounding the pastoral.’ I am deeply thankful that we have a poet of her unique and singular talent writing today."" —Kwame DawesTaking its name from the moon's dark plains, misidentified as seas by early astronomers, the black maria investigates African diasporic histories, the consequences of racism within American culture, and the question of human identity.

His powerful new collection offers a poetry that simultaneously explores hope and horror while documenting the transformative processes of coping. You can’t bury them all follows the narratives we construct to survive the tragic failures of our humanity to their very end: everything that’s buried by snow, dirt, and ash, just like everything that’s buried by politics, homophobia, sexism, racism, religion; and history is resurrected, demanding to be heard and addressed.In Woodcock’s poetry, how we deal with what resurfaces is the key. What do those who suffer really mean to those who have abandoned them to small, conscience-soothing charitable donations or the occasional tweet?

Over time, eight key technologies gradually freed us from the limitations of our animal origins.The fabrication of weapons, the mastery of fire, and the technologies of clothing and shelter radically restructured the human body, enabling us to walk upright, shed our body hair, and migrate out of tropical Africa. Symbolic communication transformed human evolution from a slow biological process into a fast cultural process. The invention of agriculture revolutionized the relationship between humanity and the environment, and the technologies of interaction led to the birth of civilization. Precision machinery spawned the industrial revolution and the rise of nation-states; and in the next metamorphosis, digital technologies may well unite all of humanity for the benefit of future generations.Synthesizing the findings of primatology, paleontology, archeology, history, and anthropology, Richard Currier reinterprets and retells the modern narrative of human evolution that began with the discovery of Lucy and other Australopithecus fossils.

Digital technology was supposed to usher in a new age of endless prosperity, but so far it has been used to put industrial capitalism on steroids, making it harder for people and businesses to keep up. Social networks surrender their original missions to more immediately profitable data mining, while brokerage houses abandon value investing for algorithms that drain markets and our 401ks alike--all tactics driven by the need to stoke growth by any means necessary. Instead of taking this opportunity to reprogram our economy for sustainability, we have doubled down on growth as its core command. We have reached the limits of this approach. We must escape the growth trap, once and for all. Media scholar and technology author Douglas Rushkoff--one of today's most original and influential thinkers--argues for a new economic program that utilizes the unique distributive power of the internet while breaking free of the winner-take-all system the growth trap leaves in its wake. Drawing on sources both contemporary and historical, Rushkoff pioneers a new understanding of the old economic paradigm, from central currency to debt to corporations and labor.Most importantly, he offers a series of practical steps for businesses, consumers, investors, and policymakers to remake the economic operating system from the inside out--and prosper along the way. Instead of boycotting Wal-Mart or overtaxing the wealthy, we simply implement strategies that foster the creation of value by stakeholders other than just ourselves. From our currency to our labor to the corporation, every aspect of the economy can be reprogrammed with minimal disruption to create a more equitably distributed prosperity for all.Inspiring and challenging, Throwing Rocks at the Google Bus provides a pragmatic, optimistic, and human-centered model for economic progress in the digital age. ...more",capital in the twenty first century meets the second machine age in this stunning and optimistic tour de force on the promise and peril of the digital economy from one of the most brilliant social critics of our time digital technology was supposed to usher in a new age of endless prosperity but so far it has been used to put industrial capitalism on steroids makin capital in the twenty first century meets the second machine age in this stunning and optimistic tour de force on the promise and peril of the digital economy from one of the most brilliant social critics of our time digital technology was supposed to usher in a new age of endless prosperity but so far it has been used to put industrial capitalism on steroids making it harder for people and businesses to keep up social networks surrender their original missions to more immediately profitable data mining while brokerage houses abandon value investing for algorithms that drain markets and our ks alike all tactics driven by the need to stoke growth by any means necessary instead of taking this opportunity to reprogram our economy for sustainability we have doubled down on growth as its core command we have reached the limits of this approach we must escape the growth trap once and for all media scholar and technology author douglas rushkoff one of today s most original and influential thinkers argues for a new economic program that utilizes the unique distributive power of the internet while breaking free of the winner take all system the growth trap leaves in its wake drawing on sources both contemporary and historical rushkoff pioneers a new understanding of the old economic paradigm from central currency to debt to corporations and labor most importantly he offers a series of practical steps for businesses consumers investors and policymakers to remake the economic operating system from the inside out and prosper along the way instead of boycotting wal mart or overtaxing the wealthy we simply implement strategies that foster the creation of value by stakeholders other than just ourselves from our currency to our labor to the corporation every aspect of the economy can be reprogrammed with minimal disruption to create a more equitably distributed prosperity for all inspiring and challenging throwing rocks at the google bus provides a pragmatic optimistic and human centered model for economic progress in the digital age more,Unknown

They are the only family she has, aside from her paternal grandmother Dorothy, so when her uncle dies from the attack and her father lays comatose in ICU, it falls to Andrea to not only investigate who would want to kill her father and uncle, but also to oversee Harding Industries, the family company. When her father’s longtime attorney and one of a handful of family friends, Beth Cowling, rushes to help Andrea long distance, the youngest Harding soon finds herself surrounded by a bevy of intriguing new friends and helpers. First to arrive is Beth’s own daughter, Riva, acting as Andrea’s attorney after Andrea is violently attacked in her father’s home, where she grew up, forcing her to kill both would-be assassins. When Nicholas’s on again/off again lover, state prosecutor and gubernatorial hopeful Kerry Marcus, is equally at a loss to name suspects in the Harding family attacks, Riva begins her own investigation into the short list of family friends and colleagues, including Don Marshall, former colleague of Nicholas’s at Marshall Pharmaceutical, which Don now runs, and Don’s wife Karen. Marshall has a shady past, including an incident at his company that also involved Andrea’s father. She also looks closely at Marcus Ricci, father of Andrea’s closest high school friend, Jason. After Jason’s death from leukemia, Ricci becomes like a second father to Andrea. Ricci is also widely believed to have ties to the New Jersey mob. But Beth has another contact she wants involved in the investigation, Deirdre Southington, daughter of Beth’s old friend Cordelia Southington. The Southington family has more money than God, as well as, through Deirdre, more contacts in the intriguing world of international espionage. A former NSA agent, Deirdre is mysterious and beautiful in a cold way. An eccentric who travels via private rail car, she is also extraordinarily persuasive, holding a PhD in forensic psychology that she has put to great use in both her work with the NSA and on her own, as a defender of good, rooting out evil doers and ensuring they are brought to her own brand of justice. Andrea, Riva, and Deirdre all also cast a suspicious eye on the Oakes brothers, Carlton and Jefferson, who run Oakes Industries along with their silent partner and cousin, New Jersey state senator Schuyler Colfax, who also has his eye on the governor’s seat. Oakes Industries has recently made an attempt to purchase Harding Industries, a seemingly irrational move that is rebuffed by Nicholas. What no one knows until much later is that the Oakes brothers have entered into a business deal with Russian mobster Viktor Roman, who represents the real party interested in acquiring Harding Industries, a Vor, Russian organized crime unit, with heavy international interests in the energy sector. Andrea matures quickly as she rapidly learns who she can and cannot trust during her search for the people out to kill her family. Along with her new friends and advocates, she discovers Harding Industries holds a soon to expire option to buy property that could become the source of untold billions from oil reserves, and moves in the nick of time to exercise their right to purchase. But the biggest blow for the Harding family is yet to come—the discovery that Viktor Roman has promised Kerry Marcus the governor’s seat in exchange for information about the Hardings, including Nicholas and Michael’s whereabouts on the night they are shot. Ultimately, Andrea chooses to forego law school and becomes her father’s new partner in Harding Industries, no doubt with many adventures yet to come. Masterfully told using a smattering of historical facts along with a soundtrack of classical music masterpieces, this thriller keeps readers on edge until the very end. ...more",andrea harding is a recent college graduate looking forward to attending duke law school when her world is turned upside down by the shooting of her father nicholas and uncle michael in a surprising and puzzling attack they are the only family she has aside from her paternal grandmother dorothy so when her uncle dies from the attack and her father lays comatose in i andrea harding is a recent college graduate looking forward to attending duke law school when her world is turned upside down by the shooting of her father nicholas and uncle michael in a surprising and puzzling attack they are the only family she has aside from her paternal grandmother dorothy so when her uncle dies from the attack and her father lays comatose in icu it falls to andrea to not only investigate who would want to kill her father and uncle but also to oversee harding industries the family company when her father s longtime attorney and one of a handful of family friends beth cowling rushes to help andrea long distance the youngest harding soon finds herself surrounded by a bevy of intriguing new friends and helpers first to arrive is beth s own daughter riva acting as andrea s attorney after andrea is violently attacked in her father s home where she grew up forcing her to kill both would be assassins when nicholas s on again off again lover state prosecutor and gubernatorial hopeful kerry marcus is equally at a loss to name suspects in the harding family attacks riva begins her own investigation into the short list of family friends and colleagues including don marshall former colleague of nicholas s at marshall pharmaceutical which don now runs and don s wife karen marshall has a shady past including an incident at his company that also involved andrea s father she also looks closely at marcus ricci father of andrea s closest high school friend jason after jason s death from leukemia ricci becomes like a second father to andrea ricci is also widely believed to have ties to the new jersey mob but beth has another contact she wants involved in the investigation deirdre southington daughter of beth s old friend cordelia southington the southington family has more money than god as well as through deirdre more contacts in the intriguing world of international espionage a former nsa agent deirdre is mysterious and beautiful in a cold way an eccentric who travels via private rail car she is also extraordinarily persuasive holding a phd in forensic psychology that she has put to great use in both her work with the nsa and on her own as a defender of good rooting out evil doers and ensuring they are brought to her own brand of justice andrea riva and deirdre all also cast a suspicious eye on the oakes brothers carlton and jefferson who run oakes industries along with their silent partner and cousin new jersey state senator schuyler colfax who also has his eye on the governor s seat oakes industries has recently made an attempt to purchase harding industries a seemingly irrational move that is rebuffed by nicholas what no one knows until much later is that the oakes brothers have entered into a business deal with russian mobster viktor roman who represents the real party interested in acquiring harding industries a vor russian organized crime unit with heavy international interests in the energy sector andrea matures quickly as she rapidly learns who she can and cannot trust during her search for the people out to kill her family along with her new friends and advocates she discovers harding industries holds a soon to expire option to buy property that could become the source of untold billions from oil reserves and moves in the nick of time to exercise their right to purchase but the biggest blow for the harding family is yet to come the discovery that viktor roman has promised kerry marcus the governor s seat in exchange for information about the hardings including nicholas and michael s whereabouts on the night they are shot ultimately andrea chooses to forego law school and becomes her father s new partner in harding industries no doubt with many adventures yet to come masterfully told using a smattering of historical facts along with a soundtrack of classical music masterpieces this thriller keeps readers on edge until the very end more,Unknown

Within a matter of h Renowned ornithologist Tim Birkhead opens this gripping story as a female guillemot chick hatches, already carrying her full quota of tiny eggs within her undeveloped ovary. As she grows into adulthood, only a few of her eggs mature, are released into the oviduct, and are fertilized by sperm stored from copulation that took place days or weeks earlier. Within a matter of hours, the fragile yolk is surrounded by albumen and the whole is gradually encased within a turquoise jewel of a shell. Soon afterward the fully formed egg is expelled onto a bare rocky ledge, where it will be incubated for four weeks before another chick emerges and the life cycle begins again. A Bird's Egg is about how eggs in general are made, fertilized, developed, and hatched. The eggs of most birds spend just 24 hours in the oviduct; however, that journey takes 48 hours in cuckoos, which surreptitiously lay their eggs in the nests of other birds. From the earliest times, the study of birds' ovaries and ova (eggs) played a vital role in the quest to unravel the mysteries of fertilization and embryo development in humans. Birkhead uses birds' eggs as wondrous portals into natural history, enlivened by the stories of naturalists and scientists, including Birkhead and his students, whose discoveries have advanced current scientific knowledge of reproduction. ...more",renowned ornithologist tim birkhead opens this gripping story as a female guillemot chick hatches already carrying her full quota of tiny eggs within her undeveloped ovary as she grows into adulthood only a few of her eggs mature are released into the oviduct and are fertilized by sperm stored from copulation that took place days or weeks earlier within a matter of h renowned ornithologist tim birkhead opens this gripping story as a female guillemot chick hatches already carrying her full quota of tiny eggs within her undeveloped ovary as she grows into adulthood only a few of her eggs mature are released into the oviduct and are fertilized by sperm stored from copulation that took place days or weeks earlier within a matter of hours the fragile yolk is surrounded by albumen and the whole is gradually encased within a turquoise jewel of a shell soon afterward the fully formed egg is expelled onto a bare rocky ledge where it will be incubated for four weeks before another chick emerges and the life cycle begins again a bird s egg is about how eggs in general are made fertilized developed and hatched the eggs of most birds spend just hours in the oviduct however that journey takes hours in cuckoos which surreptitiously lay their eggs in the nests of other birds from the earliest times the study of birds ovaries and ova eggs played a vital role in the quest to unravel the mysteries of fertilization and embryo development in humans birkhead uses birds eggs as wondrous portals into natural history enlivened by the stories of naturalists and scientists including birkhead and his students whose discoveries have advanced current scientific knowledge of reproduction more,Unknown

Ripping suspense, sheer terror, and a wrenching love story.” —Sandra Brown, New York Times bestselling author of FrictionThe terrible truth about Manderley is that someone is always watching. Manderley Resort is a gleaming, new twenty-story hotel on the California coast. It’s about to open its doors, and the world--at least those with the means to afford it--will be welcomed into a palace of opulence and unparalleled security. But someone is determined that Manderley will never open. The staff has no idea that their every move is being watched, and over the next twelve hours they will be killed off, one by one. Writing in the tradition of Edgar Allan Poe and Stephen King, and with a deep bow to Daphne du Maurier, author Gina Wohlsdorf pairs narrative ingenuity and razor-wire prose with quick twists, sharp turns, and gasp-inducing terror. Security is grand guignol storytelling at its very best. A shocking thriller, a brilliant narrative puzzle, and a multifaceted love story unlike any other, Security marks the debut of a fearless and gifted writer. “Be surprised, be very surprised: Gina Wohlsdorf brings more than just plot twists and a terrifically tender love story to this thriller . . . It’s her playful homage to Hitchcock and du Maurier that had me reading, howling, and just plain loving this novel.” —Sara Gruen, author of At the Water’s Edge “Grand Hotel meets Psycho in the age of surveillance . . . Security is cinematically vivid, crisply written, and sharp enough to cut . . . Wohlsdorf brilliantly subverts our expectations of the action genre in this smart, shocking, poignant thriller.” —Emily Croy Barker, author of The Thinking Woman’s Guide to Real Magic “The thrill of this novel goes beyond its wickedly clever,  split-screen, high-tech wizardry—a kind of video gamer’s literary retake of Hitchcock’s Rear Window--and emanates  from its strange, disembodied narrator . . . The effect is terrifying, sexy, dizzying, and impossible to look away from.” —Tim Johnston, author of Descent “Shocking and filled with Tarantino-ish dark humor. . . Structurally reminiscent of the amazing Jennifer Egan,Wohlsdorf’s book is certainly a hybrid, like nothing else. Get ready.” —Ann Beattie, author of The State We’re In “Flawless . . . Security is perfectly tuned for blockbuster status . . . They don’t make a hotel big enough to house all the people who will want to read this, and soon, as in Manderley, all eyes will be on Wohlsdorf.” —Daniel Kraus, Booklist, starred review   ...more", original and imaginative ripping suspense sheer terror and a wrenching love story sandra brown new york times bestselling author of frictionthe terrible truth about manderley is that someone is always watching manderley resort is a gleaming new twenty story hotel on the california coast it s about to open its doors and the world at least those with the me original and imaginative ripping suspense sheer terror and a wrenching love story sandra brown new york times bestselling author of frictionthe terrible truth about manderley is that someone is always watching manderley resort is a gleaming new twenty story hotel on the california coast it s about to open its doors and the world at least those with the means to afford it will be welcomed into a palace of opulence and unparalleled security but someone is determined that manderley will never open the staff has no idea that their every move is being watched and over the next twelve hours they will be killed off one by one writing in the tradition of edgar allan poe and stephen king and with a deep bow to daphne du maurier author gina wohlsdorf pairs narrative ingenuity and razor wire prose with quick twists sharp turns and gasp inducing terror security is grand guignol storytelling at its very best a shocking thriller a brilliant narrative puzzle and a multifaceted love story unlike any other security marks the debut of a fearless and gifted writer be surprised be very surprised gina wohlsdorf brings more than just plot twists and a terrifically tender love story to this thriller it s her playful homage to hitchcock and du maurier that had me reading howling and just plain loving this novel sara gruen author of at the water s edge grand hotel meets psycho in the age of surveillance security is cinematically vivid crisply written and sharp enough to cut wohlsdorf brilliantly subverts our expectations of the action genre in this smart shocking poignant thriller emily croy barker author of the thinking woman s guide to real magic the thrill of this novel goes beyond its wickedly clever split screen high tech wizardry a kind of video gamer s literary retake of hitchcock s rear window and emanates from its strange disembodied narrator the effect is terrifying sexy dizzying and impossible to look away from tim johnston author of descent shocking and filled with tarantino ish dark humor structurally reminiscent of the amazing jennifer egan wohlsdorf s book is certainly a hybrid like nothing else get ready ann beattie author of the state we re in flawless security is perfectly tuned for blockbuster status they don t make a hotel big enough to house all the people who will want to read this and soon as in manderley all eyes will be on wohlsdorf daniel kraus booklist starred review more,Benjamin Graham

But we don't have a skilled enough labor pool to fill the positions that will be created, which are in many cases technically demanding and require specialized skills. A decades-long series of idealistic educational policies with the expressed goal of getting every student to go to college has left a generation of potential workers out of the system.

The United States can prepare a new, high-performance labor force if we revamp our school system to value industry apprenticeship and rigorous technical education.

If you wanted to get literal, it is about an inner city boy, Sinclair, who discovers a pair of discarded angel wings. With these wings, Sinclair flies around the city and gets into adventures."" - Farel Dalrymple, series creator From Publishers Weekly: Collecting the first five issues of Dalrymple's acclaimed comic book series Pop Gun War, this book provides a capsule look at Dalrymple's vision of urban fantasy. Set in New York, his stories follow characters with wings, talking fish, giants, dwarves and other fantastical acquaintances and ideas. At the center of it all is a boy named Sinclair, who acquires a set of wings when a tattooed, disgruntled angel pays to have them cut off. Sinclair, a lonely kid prone to bowties and being teased, sets off on a series of encounters across the city. His older sister, a singer in a rock band, is an inspiration and worry; a homeless man of unknown powers and origins joins him; and a band of youths pursue him. Dalrymple renders this gang of eccentrics and mystics in a loose but realistic pen and ink style highly dynamic and tailor-made for depicting New York's teeming city streets. He has a flair for the dramatic as well scenes of Sinclair flying, or of a giant walking the streets, are genuinely affecting, while seeming completely natural and brings to life a subtle kind of cartoon surrealism. The story meanders a bit, and it's not always clear where it's headed, but the fun of Pop Gun War is in its vivid characters and details. It is a fine debut, reminiscent of DC Comics's Vertigo line, with which it should sit comfortably on bookstores' and adventurous readers' shelves. ...more", pop gun war is about childhood self discovery oppression guilt dreams loneliness whatever it is more about a feeling you the reader get from the story rather than a typical narrative if you wanted to get literal it is about an inner city boy sinclair who discovers a pair of discarded angel wings with these wings sinclair flies around the city and gets into pop gun war is about childhood self discovery oppression guilt dreams loneliness whatever it is more about a feeling you the reader get from the story rather than a typical narrative if you wanted to get literal it is about an inner city boy sinclair who discovers a pair of discarded angel wings with these wings sinclair flies around the city and gets into adventures farel dalrymple series creator from publishers weekly collecting the first five issues of dalrymple s acclaimed comic book series pop gun war this book provides a capsule look at dalrymple s vision of urban fantasy set in new york his stories follow characters with wings talking fish giants dwarves and other fantastical acquaintances and ideas at the center of it all is a boy named sinclair who acquires a set of wings when a tattooed disgruntled angel pays to have them cut off sinclair a lonely kid prone to bowties and being teased sets off on a series of encounters across the city his older sister a singer in a rock band is an inspiration and worry a homeless man of unknown powers and origins joins him and a band of youths pursue him dalrymple renders this gang of eccentrics and mystics in a loose but realistic pen and ink style highly dynamic and tailor made for depicting new york s teeming city streets he has a flair for the dramatic as well scenes of sinclair flying or of a giant walking the streets are genuinely affecting while seeming completely natural and brings to life a subtle kind of cartoon surrealism the story meanders a bit and it s not always clear where it s headed but the fun of pop gun war is in its vivid characters and details it is a fine debut reminiscent of dc comics s vertigo line with which it should sit comfortably on bookstores and adventurous readers shelves more,Unknown

Metchnikoff’s daring theory of immunity—that voracious cells he called phagocytes formed the first line of defense against invading bacteria—would eventually earn the scientist a Nobel Prize, shared with his archrival, as well as the unofficial m oniker “Father of Natural Immunity.” But first he had to win over skeptics, especially those who called his theory “an oriental fairy tale.” Using previously inaccessible archival materials, author Luba Vikhanski chronicles Metchnikoff’s remarkable life and discoveries in the first moder n biography of this hero of medicine. Metchnikoff was a towering figure in the scientific community of the early twentieth century, a tireless humanitarian who, while working at the Pasteur Institute in Paris, also strived to curb the spread of cholera, syphilis, and other deadly diseases. In his later years, he startled the world with controversial theories on longevity, launching a global craze for yogurt, and pioneered research into gut microbes and aging.

On the other hand, if you do the opposite, you may yet join the ranks of happy people everywhere!There are stacks upon stacks of self-help books that will promise you love, happiness, and a fabulous life. But how can you pinpoint the exact behaviors that cause you to be miserable in the first place?

We feel unqualified to do God’s work or to live out the calling we imagine. But God has a way of using our weaknesses for good. In fact, God loves unqualified people.In (Un)Qualified, Who You Think You Are is Not as Important as Who God Says You AreMany of us wrestle with the gap between our weaknesses and our dreams, between who we are and who God says we are meant to be. We feel unqualified to do God’s work or to live out the calling we imagine. But God has a way of using our weaknesses for good. In fact, God loves unqualified people.In (Un)Qualified, Pastor Steven Furtick helps you peel back the assumptions you’ve made about yourself and see yourself as God sees you. Because true peace and confidence come not from worldly perfection but from acceptance: God’s acceptance of you, your acceptance of yourself, and your acceptance of God’s process of change.This is a book about understanding your identity in light of who God is. It’s a book about coming to terms with the good, the bad, and the unmentionable in your life and learning to let God use you. It’s about charging into the gap between your present and your hopes and meeting God there. After all, God can’t bless who you pretend to be. But he longs to bless who you really are; a flawed and broken person. Good thing for us that God is in the business of using broken people to do big things. Being Unqualified Is God’s Favorite QualificationOur culture tells us that the answer to our failures is to fix them. The solution to our weaknesses is to hide them. The secret to our success is to appear as flawless as possible. But God’s qualifying system is different than the world’s. So is his view of our weaknesses, our purpose, and our true selves.In (Un)Qualified, Steven Furtick explores who God is as the great “I AM,” and then helps us discover our own identity.

Smith helps readers recognize the formative power of culture and the transformative possibilities of Christian practices. He explains that worship is the ""imagination station"" that incubates our loves and longings so that our cultural endeavors are indexed toward God and his kingdom. This is why the church and worshiping in a local community of believers should be the hub and heart of Christian formation and discipleship.Following the publication of his influential work Desiring the Kingdom, Smith received numerous requests from pastors and leaders for a more accessible version of that book's content. No mere abridgment, this new book draws on years of Smith's popular presentations on the ideas presented in Desiring the Kingdom to offer a fresh, bottom-up rearticulation.

Among them: James Bennett, a synesthetic art critic for The New York Times whose unlikely condition enables him to describe art in profound, magical ways, and Raul Engales, an exiled Argentinian painter running from his past and the Dirty War that has enveloped his country. As the two men ascend in the downtown arts scene, dual tragedies strike, and each is faced with a loss that acutely affects his relationship to life and to art. It is not until they are inadvertently brought together by Lucy Olliason—a small town beauty and Raul’s muse—and a young orphan boy sent mysteriously from Buenos Aires, that James and Raul are able to rediscover some semblance of what they’ve lost.As inventive as Jennifer Egan's A Visit From The Goon Squad and as sweeping as Meg Wolitzer's The Interestings, Tuesday Nights in 1980 boldly renders a complex moment when the meaning and nature of art is being all but upended, and New York City as a whole is reinventing itself.

Brian Kilmeade – cohost of “Fox & Friends” on Fox News and the national radio show “Kilmeade & Friends” – returns with another fascinating historical narrative, co-written with Don Yaeger. From the authors of the  New York Times  bestseller  George Washington’s Secret Six , the little-known story of Thomas Jefferson’s battle to defend America against Islamic pirates. Brian Kilmeade – cohost of “Fox & Friends” on Fox News and the national radio show “Kilmeade & Friends” – returns with another fascinating historical narrative, co-written with Don Yaeger. Like their acclaimed bestseller George Washington's Secret Six, Thomas Jefferson and the Tripoli Pirates sheds new light on a vitally important episode that has been forgotten by most Americans.   Only weeks after President Jefferson's inauguration in 1801, he decided to confront the Tripoli pirates who had been kidnapping American ships and sailors, among other outrageous acts. Though inclined toward diplomacy, Jefferson sent warships to blockade Tripoli and protect American shipping, and then escalated to all-out war against the Barbary states.   The tiny American flotilla—with three frigates representing half of the U.S. Navy’s top-of-the-line ships—had some success in blockading the Barbary coast. But that success came to an end when the USS Philadelphia ran aground in Tripoli harbor and was captured. Kilmeade and Yaeger recount the dramatic story of a young American sailor, Stephen Decatur, who snuck into the harbor, boarded the Philadelphia, and set her on fire before escaping amid a torrent of enemy gunfire.   Another amazing story is that of William Eaton’s daring attack on the port city of Derna. He led a detachment of Marines on a 500-mile trek across the desert to surprise the port. His strategy worked, and an American flag was raised in victory on foreign soil for the first time.     Few remember Decatur and Eaton today, but their legacy inspired the opening of the Marine Corps Hymn: “From the halls of Montezuma to the shores of Tripoli, we fight our country’s battles in the air, on land, and sea.” Thomas Jefferson and the Tripoli Pirates tells a dramatic story of bravery, diplomacy, and battle on the high seas, and honors some of America’s forgotten heroes.  ...more",from the authors of the new york times bestseller george washington s secret six the little known story of thomas jefferson s battle to defend america against islamic pirates brian kilmeade cohost of fox friends on fox news and the national radio show kilmeade friends returns with another fascinating historical narrative co written with don yaeger from the authors of the new york times bestseller george washington s secret six the little known story of thomas jefferson s battle to defend america against islamic pirates brian kilmeade cohost of fox friends on fox news and the national radio show kilmeade friends returns with another fascinating historical narrative co written with don yaeger like their acclaimed bestseller george washington s secret six thomas jefferson and the tripoli pirates sheds new light on a vitally important episode that has been forgotten by most americans only weeks after president jefferson s inauguration in he decided to confront the tripoli pirates who had been kidnapping american ships and sailors among other outrageous acts though inclined toward diplomacy jefferson sent warships to blockade tripoli and protect american shipping and then escalated to all out war against the barbary states the tiny american flotilla with three frigates representing half of the u s navy s top of the line ships had some success in blockading the barbary coast but that success came to an end when the uss philadelphia ran aground in tripoli harbor and was captured kilmeade and yaeger recount the dramatic story of a young american sailor stephen decatur who snuck into the harbor boarded the philadelphia and set her on fire before escaping amid a torrent of enemy gunfire another amazing story is that of william eaton s daring attack on the port city of derna he led a detachment of marines on a mile trek across the desert to surprise the port his strategy worked and an american flag was raised in victory on foreign soil for the first time few remember decatur and eaton today but their legacy inspired the opening of the marine corps hymn from the halls of montezuma to the shores of tripoli we fight our country s battles in the air on land and sea thomas jefferson and the tripoli pirates tells a dramatic story of bravery diplomacy and battle on the high seas and honors some of america s forgotten heroes more,Worth Books

The Third Wave: An Entrepreneur’s Vision of the Future,12.61,5,http://books.toscrape.com/catalogue/the-third-wave-an-entrepreneurs-vision-of-the-future_862/index.html,"NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLERWALL STREET JOURNAL BESTSELLEROne of America’s most accomplished entrepreneurs—a pioneer who made the Internet part of everyday life and orchestrated the largest merger in the history of business—shares a roadmap for how anyone can succeed in a world of rapidly changing technology.Steve Case’s career began when he cofounded America Online (AOL) in NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLERWALL STREET JOURNAL BESTSELLEROne of America’s most accomplished entrepreneurs—a pioneer who made the Internet part of everyday life and orchestrated the largest merger in the history of business—shares a roadmap for how anyone can succeed in a world of rapidly changing technology.Steve Case’s career began when he cofounded America Online (AOL) in 1985. At the time, only three percent of Americans were online. It took a decade for AOL to achieve mainstream success, and there were many near-death experiences and back-to-the-wall pivots. AOL became the top performing company of the 1990s, and at its peak more than half of all consumer Internet traffic in the United States ran through the service. After Case engineered AOL’s merger with Time Warner and he became Chairman of the combined business, Case oversaw the biggest media and communications empire in the world. In The Third Wave, which pays homage to the work of the futurist Alvin Toffler (from whom Case has borrowed the title, and whose work inspired him as a young man), Case takes us behind the scenes of some of the most consequential and riveting business decisions of our time while offering illuminating insights from decades of working as an entrepreneur, an investor, a philanthropist, and an advocate for sensible bipartisan policies. We are entering, as Case explains, a new paradigm called the “Third Wave” of the Internet. The first wave saw AOL and other companies lay the foundation for consumers to connect to the Internet. The second wave saw companies like Google and Facebook build on top of the Internet to create search and social networking capabilities, while apps like Snapchat and Instagram leverage the smartphone revolution. Now, Case argues, we’re entering the Third Wave: a period in which entrepreneurs will vastly transform major “real world” sectors like health, education, transportation, energy, and food—and in the process change the way we live our daily lives. But success in the Third Wave will require a different skill set, and Case outlines the path forward.The Third Wave is part memoir, part manifesto, and part playbook for the future. With passion and clarity, Case explains the ways in which newly emerging technology companies (a growing number of which, he argues, will not be based in Silicon Valley) will have to rethink their relationships with customers, with competitors, and with governments; and offers advice for how entrepreneurs can make winning business decisions and strategies—and how all of us can make sense of this changing digital age. ...more",new york times bestsellerwall street journal bestsellerone of america s most accomplished entrepreneurs a pioneer who made the internet part of everyday life and orchestrated the largest merger in the history of business shares a roadmap for how anyone can succeed in a world of rapidly changing technology steve case s career began when he cofounded america online aol in new york times bestsellerwall street journal bestsellerone of america s most accomplished entrepreneurs a pioneer who made the internet part of everyday life and orchestrated the largest merger in the history of business shares a roadmap for how anyone can succeed in a world of rapidly changing technology steve case s career began when he cofounded america online aol in at the time only three percent of americans were online it took a decade for aol to achieve mainstream success and there were many near death experiences and back to the wall pivots aol became the top performing company of the s and at its peak more than half of all consumer internet traffic in the united states ran through the service after case engineered aol s merger with time warner and he became chairman of the combined business case oversaw the biggest media and communications empire in the world in the third wave which pays homage to the work of the futurist alvin toffler from whom case has borrowed the title and whose work inspired him as a young man case takes us behind the scenes of some of the most consequential and riveting business decisions of our time while offering illuminating insights from decades of working as an entrepreneur an investor a philanthropist and an advocate for sensible bipartisan policies we are entering as case explains a new paradigm called the third wave of the internet the first wave saw aol and other companies lay the foundation for consumers to connect to the internet the second wave saw companies like google and facebook build on top of the internet to create search and social networking capabilities while apps like snapchat and instagram leverage the smartphone revolution now case argues we re entering the third wave a period in which entrepreneurs will vastly transform major real world sectors like health education transportation energy and food and in the process change the way we live our daily lives but success in the third wave will require a different skill set and case outlines the path forward the third wave is part memoir part manifesto and part playbook for the future with passion and clarity case explains the ways in which newly emerging technology companies a growing number of which he argues will not be based in silicon valley will have to rethink their relationships with customers with competitors and with governments and offers advice for how entrepreneurs can make winning business decisions and strategies and how all of us can make sense of this changing digital age more,Unknown

To one degree or another this simple question assails any creature faced with a wide choice of things to eat. Anthropologists call it the omnivore's dilemma. Choosing from among the countless potential foods nature offers, humans have had to learn what is safe, and what isn't—which mushrooms should be avoided, for example, and which berries we can enjoy. Today, as America confronts what can only be described as a national eating disorder, the omnivore's dilemma has returned with an atavistic vengeance. The cornucopia of the modern American supermarket and fast-food outlet has thrown us back on a bewildering landscape where we once again have to worry about which of those tasty-looking morsels might kill us. At the same time we're realizing that our food choices also have profound implications for the health of our environment. The Omnivore's Dilemma is bestselling author Michael Pollan's brilliant and eye-opening exploration of these little-known but vitally important dimensions of eating in America. Pollan has divided The Omnivore's Dilemma into three parts, one for each of the food chains that sustain us: industrialized food, alternative or ""organic"" food, and food people obtain by dint of their own hunting, gathering, or gardening. Pollan follows each food chain literally from the ground up to the table, emphasizing our dynamic coevolutionary relationship with the species we depend on. He concludes each section by sitting down to a meal—at McDonald's, at home with his family sharing a dinner from Whole Foods, and in a revolutionary ""beyond organic"" farm in Virginia. For each meal he traces the provenance of everything consumed, revealing the hidden components we unwittingly ingest and explaining how our taste for particular foods reflects our environmental and biological inheritance. We are indeed what we eat-and what we eat remakes the world. A society of voracious and increasingly confused omnivores, we are just beginning to recognize the profound consequences of the simplest everyday food choices, both for ourselves and for the natural world. The Omnivore's Dilemma is a long-overdue book and one that will become known for bringing a completely fresh perspective to a question as ordinary and yet momentous as What shall we have for dinner?A few facts and figures from The Omnivore's Dilemma:Of the 38 ingredients it takes to make a McNugget, there are at least 13 that are derived from corn. 45 different menu items at Mcdonald’s are made from corn. One in every three American children eats fast food every day. One in every five American meals today is eaten in the car. The food industry burns nearly a fifth of all the petroleum consumed in the United States—more than we burn with our cars and more than any other industry consumes. It takes ten calories of fossil fuel energy to deliver one calorie of food energy to an American plate. A single strawberry contains about five calories. To get that strawberry from a field in California to a plate on the east coast requires 435 calories of energy. Industrial fertilizer and industrial pesticides both owe their existence to the conversion of the World War II munitions industry to civilian uses—nerve gases became pesticides, and ammonium nitrate explosives became nitrogen fertilizers. ... ...more",what should we have for dinner to one degree or another this simple question assails any creature faced with a wide choice of things to eat anthropologists call it the omnivore s dilemma choosing from among the countless potential foods nature offers humans have had to learn what is safe and what isn t which mushrooms should be avoided for example and which berries what should we have for dinner to one degree or another this simple question assails any creature faced with a wide choice of things to eat anthropologists call it the omnivore s dilemma choosing from among the countless potential foods nature offers humans have had to learn what is safe and what isn t which mushrooms should be avoided for example and which berries we can enjoy today as america confronts what can only be described as a national eating disorder the omnivore s dilemma has returned with an atavistic vengeance the cornucopia of the modern american supermarket and fast food outlet has thrown us back on a bewildering landscape where we once again have to worry about which of those tasty looking morsels might kill us at the same time we re realizing that our food choices also have profound implications for the health of our environment the omnivore s dilemma is bestselling author michael pollan s brilliant and eye opening exploration of these little known but vitally important dimensions of eating in america pollan has divided the omnivore s dilemma into three parts one for each of the food chains that sustain us industrialized food alternative or organic food and food people obtain by dint of their own hunting gathering or gardening pollan follows each food chain literally from the ground up to the table emphasizing our dynamic coevolutionary relationship with the species we depend on he concludes each section by sitting down to a meal at mcdonald s at home with his family sharing a dinner from whole foods and in a revolutionary beyond organic farm in virginia for each meal he traces the provenance of everything consumed revealing the hidden components we unwittingly ingest and explaining how our taste for particular foods reflects our environmental and biological inheritance we are indeed what we eat and what we eat remakes the world a society of voracious and increasingly confused omnivores we are just beginning to recognize the profound consequences of the simplest everyday food choices both for ourselves and for the natural world the omnivore s dilemma is a long overdue book and one that will become known for bringing a completely fresh perspective to a question as ordinary and yet momentous as what shall we have for dinner a few facts and figures from the omnivore s dilemma of the ingredients it takes to make a mcnugget there are at least that are derived from corn different menu items at mcdonald s are made from corn one in every three american children eats fast food every day one in every five american meals today is eaten in the car the food industry burns nearly a fifth of all the petroleum consumed in the united states more than we burn with our cars and more than any other industry consumes it takes ten calories of fossil fuel energy to deliver one calorie of food energy to an american plate a single strawberry contains about five calories to get that strawberry from a field in california to a plate on the east coast requires calories of energy industrial fertilizer and industrial pesticides both owe their existence to the conversion of the world war ii munitions industry to civilian uses nerve gases became pesticides and ammonium nitrate explosives became nitrogen fertilizers more,Worth Books

The apartment building in which the brutal crimes took place was already rundown, and in their aftermath a consensus developed in the community that it should be destroyed. It was a place, neighbors felt, that was plagued by spiritual cancer. In 2008, journalist Laura Tillman covered the story for The Brownsville Herald. The questions it raised haunted her, particularly one asked by the sole member of the city’s Heritage Council to oppose demolition: is there any such thing as an evil building? Her investigation took her far beyond that question, revealing the nature of the toll that the crime exacted on a city already wracked with poverty. It sprawled into a six-year inquiry into the larger significance of such acts, ones so difficult to imagine or explain that their perpetrators are often dismissed as monsters alien to humanity. With meticulous attention and stunning compassion, Tillman surveyed those surrounding the crimes, speaking with the lawyers who tried the case, the family’s neighbors and relatives and teachers, even one of the murderers: John Allen Rubio himself, whom she corresponded with for years and ultimately met in person. The result is a brilliant exploration of some of our age’s most important social issues, from poverty to mental illness to the death penalty, and a beautiful, profound meditation on the truly human forces that drive them. It is disturbing, insightful, and mesmerizing in equal measure. ...more",in cold blood meets adrian nicole leblanc s random family a harrowing profoundly personal investigation of the causes effects and communal toll of a deeply troubling crime the brutal murder of three young children by their parents in the border city of brownsville texas on march in brownsville texas one of america s poorest cities john allen rubio and angel in cold blood meets adrian nicole leblanc s random family a harrowing profoundly personal investigation of the causes effects and communal toll of a deeply troubling crime the brutal murder of three young children by their parents in the border city of brownsville texas on march in brownsville texas one of america s poorest cities john allen rubio and angela camacho murdered their three young children the apartment building in which the brutal crimes took place was already rundown and in their aftermath a consensus developed in the community that it should be destroyed it was a place neighbors felt that was plagued by spiritual cancer in journalist laura tillman covered the story for the brownsville herald the questions it raised haunted her particularly one asked by the sole member of the city s heritage council to oppose demolition is there any such thing as an evil building her investigation took her far beyond that question revealing the nature of the toll that the crime exacted on a city already wracked with poverty it sprawled into a six year inquiry into the larger significance of such acts ones so difficult to imagine or explain that their perpetrators are often dismissed as monsters alien to humanity with meticulous attention and stunning compassion tillman surveyed those surrounding the crimes speaking with the lawyers who tried the case the family s neighbors and relatives and teachers even one of the murderers john allen rubio himself whom she corresponded with for years and ultimately met in person the result is a brilliant exploration of some of our age s most important social issues from poverty to mental illness to the death penalty and a beautiful profound meditation on the truly human forces that drive them it is disturbing insightful and mesmerizing in equal measure more,Unknown

The Genius of Birds,17.24,1,http://books.toscrape.com/catalogue/the-genius-of-birds_843/index.html,"Birds are astonishingly intelligent creatures. In fact, according to revolutionary new research, some birds rival primates and even humans in their remarkable forms of intelligence. Like humans, many birds have enormous brains relative to their size. Although small, bird brains are packed with neurons that allow them to punch well above their weight. InThe Genius of Birds, Birds are astonishingly intelligent creatures. In fact, according to revolutionary new research, some birds rival primates and even humans in their remarkable forms of intelligence.  Like humans, many birds have enormous brains relative to their size. Although small, bird brains are packed with neurons that allow them to punch well above their weight. In The Genius of Birds, acclaimed author Jennifer Ackerman explores the newly discovered brilliance of birds and how it came about. As she travels around the world to the most cutting-edge frontiers of research— the distant laboratories of Barbados and New Caledonia, the great tit communities of the United Kingdom and the bowerbird habitats of Australia, the ravaged mid-Atlantic coast after Hurricane Sandy and the warming mountains of central Virginia and the western states—Ackerman not only tells the story of the recently uncovered genius of birds but also delves deeply into the latest findings about the bird brain itself that are revolutionizing our view of what it means to be intelligent.Consider, as Ackerman does, the Clark’s nutcracker, a bird that can hide as many as 30,000 seeds over dozens of square miles and remember where it put them several months later; the mockingbirds and thrashers, species that can store 200 to 2,000 different songs in a brain a thousand times smaller than ours; the well-known pigeon, which knows where it’s going, even thousands of miles from familiar territory; and the New Caledonian crow, an impressive bird that makes its own tools. But beyond highlighting how birds use their unique genius in technical ways, Ackerman points out the impressive social smarts of birds. They deceive and manipulate. They eavesdrop. They display a strong sense of fairness. They give gifts. They play keep-away and tug-of-war. They tease. They share. They cultivate social networks. They vie for status. They kiss to console one another. They teach their young. They blackmail their parents. They alert one another to danger. They summon witnesses to the death of a peer. They may even grieve. This elegant scientific investigation and travelogue weaves personal anecdotes with fascinating science. Ackerman delivers an extraordinary story that will both give readers a new appreciation for the exceptional talents of birds and let them discover what birds can reveal about our changing world. Incredibly informative and beautifully written, The Genius of Birds richly celebrates the triumphs of these surprising and fiercely intelligent creatures. ...more",birds are astonishingly intelligent creatures in fact according to revolutionary new research some birds rival primates and even humans in their remarkable forms of intelligence like humans many birds have enormous brains relative to their size although small bird brains are packed with neurons that allow them to punch well above their weight inthe genius of birds birds are astonishingly intelligent creatures in fact according to revolutionary new research some birds rival primates and even humans in their remarkable forms of intelligence like humans many birds have enormous brains relative to their size although small bird brains are packed with neurons that allow them to punch well above their weight in the genius of birds acclaimed author jennifer ackerman explores the newly discovered brilliance of birds and how it came about as she travels around the world to the most cutting edge frontiers of research the distant laboratories of barbados and new caledonia the great tit communities of the united kingdom and the bowerbird habitats of australia the ravaged mid atlantic coast after hurricane sandy and the warming mountains of central virginia and the western states ackerman not only tells the story of the recently uncovered genius of birds but also delves deeply into the latest findings about the bird brain itself that are revolutionizing our view of what it means to be intelligent consider as ackerman does the clark s nutcracker a bird that can hide as many as seeds over dozens of square miles and remember where it put them several months later the mockingbirds and thrashers species that can store to different songs in a brain a thousand times smaller than ours the well known pigeon which knows where it s going even thousands of miles from familiar territory and the new caledonian crow an impressive bird that makes its own tools but beyond highlighting how birds use their unique genius in technical ways ackerman points out the impressive social smarts of birds they deceive and manipulate they eavesdrop they display a strong sense of fairness they give gifts they play keep away and tug of war they tease they share they cultivate social networks they vie for status they kiss to console one another they teach their young they blackmail their parents they alert one another to danger they summon witnesses to the death of a peer they may even grieve this elegant scientific investigation and travelogue weaves personal anecdotes with fascinating science ackerman delivers an extraordinary story that will both give readers a new appreciation for the exceptional talents of birds and let them discover what birds can reveal about our changing world incredibly informative and beautifully written the genius of birds richly celebrates the triumphs of these surprising and fiercely intelligent creatures more,Jennifer Ackerman

T Now a New York Times BestsellerA hilarious, thoughtful, and in-depth exploration of the pleasures and perils of modern romance from one of this generation’s sharpest comedic voicesAt some point, every one of us embarks on a journey to find love. We meet people, date, get into and out of relationships, all with the hope of finding someone with whom we share a deep connection. This seems standard now, but it’s wildly different from what people did even just decades ago. Single people today have more romantic options than at any point in human history. With technology, our abilities to connect with and sort through these options are staggering. So why are so many people frustrated?Some of our problems are unique to our time. “Why did this guy just text me an emoji of a pizza?” “Should I go out with this girl even though she listed Combos as one of her favorite snack foods? Combos?!” “My girlfriend just got a message from some dude named Nathan. Who’s Nathan? Did he just send her a photo of his penis? Should I check just to be sure?” But the transformation of our romantic lives can’t be explained by technology alone. In a short period of time, the whole culture of finding love has changed dramatically. A few decades ago, people would find a decent person who lived in their neighborhood. Their families would meet and, after deciding neither party seemed like a murderer, they would get married and soon have a kid, all by the time they were twenty-four. Today, people marry later than ever and spend years of their lives on a quest to find the perfect person, a soul mate.For years, Aziz Ansari has been aiming his comic insight at modern romance, but for Modern Romance, the book, he decided he needed to take things to another level. He teamed up with NYU sociologist Eric Klinenberg and designed a massive research project, including hundreds of interviews and focus groups conducted everywhere from Tokyo to Buenos Aires to Wichita. They analyzed behavioral data and surveys and created their own online research forum on Reddit, which drew thousands of messages. They enlisted the world’s leading social scientists, including Andrew Cherlin, Eli Finkel, Helen Fisher, Sheena Iyengar, Barry Schwartz, Sherry Turkle, and Robb Willer. The result is unlike any social science or humor book we’ve seen before.In Modern Romance, Ansari combines his irreverent humor with cutting-edge social science to give us an unforgettable tour of our new romantic world. ...more",now a new york times bestsellera hilarious thoughtful and in depth exploration of thepleasures and perils of modern romance from one of this generation s sharpest comedic voicesat some point every one of us embarks on a journey to find love we meet people date getinto and out of relationships all with the hopeof finding someone with whom we share a deepconnection t now a new york times bestsellera hilarious thoughtful and in depth exploration of the pleasures and perils of modern romance from one of this generation s sharpest comedic voicesat some point every one of us embarks on a journey to find love we meet people date get into and out of relationships all with the hope of finding someone with whom we share a deep connection this seems standard now but it s wildly different from what people did even just decades ago single people today have more romantic options than at any point in human history with technology our abilities to connect with and sort through these options are staggering so why are so many people frustrated some of our problems are unique to our time why did this guy just text me an emoji of a pizza should i go out with this girl even though she listed combos as one of her favorite snack foods combos my girlfriend just got a message from some dude named nathan who s nathan did he just send her a photo of his penis should i check just to be sure but the transformation of our romantic lives can t be explained by technology alone in a short period of time the whole culture of finding love has changed dramatically a few decades ago people would find a decent person who lived in their neighborhood their families would meet and after deciding neither party seemed like a murderer they would get married and soon have a kid all by the time they were twenty four today people marry later than ever and spend years of their lives on a quest to find the perfect person a soul mate for years aziz ansari has been aiming his comic insight at modern romance but for modern romance the book he decided he needed to take things to another level he teamed up with nyu sociologist eric klinenberg and designed a massive research project including hundreds of interviews and focus groups conducted everywhere from tokyo to buenos aires to wichita they analyzed behavioral data and surveys and created their own online research forum on reddit which drew thousands of messages they enlisted the world s leading social scientists including andrew cherlin eli finkel helen fisher sheena iyengar barry schwartz sherry turkle and robb willer the result is unlike any social science or humor book we ve seen before in modern romance ansari combines his irreverent humor with cutting edge social science to give us an unforgettable tour of our new romantic world more,Aziz Ansari

And yet John Quincy fell in love with her, almost despite himself. Their often tempestuous but deeply close marriage lasted half a century.  They lived in Prussia, Massachusetts, Washington, Russia, and England, at royal courts, on farms, in cities, and in the White House. Louisa saw more of Europe and America than nearly any other woman of her time. But wherever she lived, she was always pressing her nose against the glass, not quite sure whether she was looking in or out. The other members of the Adams family could take their identity for granted—they were Adamses; they were Americans—but she had to invent her own. The story of Louisa Catherine Adams is one of a woman who forged a sense of self. As the country her husband led found its place in the world, she found a voice. That voice resonates still.  In this deeply felt biography, the talented journalist and historian Louisa Thomas finally gives Louisa Catherine Adams's full extraordinary life its due. An intimate portrait of a remarkable woman, a complicated marriage, and a pivotal historical moment, Louisa Thomas's biography is a masterful work from an elegant storyteller. ...more",an intimate portrait of louisa catherine adams the wife of john quincy adams who witnessed firsthand the greatest transformations of her time born in london to an american father and a british mother on the eve of the revolutionary war louisa catherine johnson was raised in circumstances very different from the new england upbringing of the future president john quincy an intimate portrait of louisa catherine adams the wife of john quincy adams who witnessed firsthand the greatest transformations of her time born in london to an american father and a british mother on the eve of the revolutionary war louisa catherine johnson was raised in circumstances very different from the new england upbringing of the future president john quincy adams whose life had been dedicated to public service from the earliest age and yet john quincy fell in love with her almost despite himself their often tempestuous but deeply close marriage lasted half a century they lived in prussia massachusetts washington russia and england at royal courts on farms in cities and in the white house louisa saw more of europe and america than nearly any other woman of her time but wherever she lived she was always pressing her nose against the glass not quite sure whether she was looking in or out the other members of the adams family could take their identity for granted they were adamses they were americans but she had to invent her own the story of louisa catherine adams is one of a woman who forged a sense of self as the country her husband led found its place in the world she found a voice that voice resonates still in this deeply felt biography the talented journalist and historian louisa thomas finally gives louisa catherine adams s full extraordinary life its due an intimate portrait of a remarkable woman a complicated marriage and a pivotal historical moment louisa thomas s biography is a masterful work from an elegant storyteller more,Unknown

For millennia this massif in eastern Turkey has been rumored as the resting place of Noah’s Ark following the Great Flood. But it also plays a significant role in the longstanding conflict between Turkey and Armenia.Author Rick Antonson joined a five-member expedition to the mountain’s nearly 17,000-foot summit, trekking alongside a contingent of Armenians, for whom Mount Ararat is the stolen symbol of their country. Antonson weaves vivid historical anecdote with unexpected travel vignettes, whether tracing earlier mountaineering attempts on the peak, recounting the genocide of Armenians and its unresolved debate, or depicting the Kurds’ ambitions for their own nation’s borders, which some say should include Mount Ararat.What unfolds in Full Moon Over Noah’s Ark is one man’s odyssey, a tale told through many stories.

It’s important to make sure we have other soldiers around us and we are armed with the Sword of the Spirit.

I listen for wisdom, and beauty, and for voices not shouting to be heard. This book chronicles some of what I’ve learned in what has become a conversation across time and generations, across disciplines and denominations.” Peabody Award-winning broadcaster and National Humanities Medalist Krista Tippett has interviewed the most extr “I’m a person who listens for a living.  I listen for wisdom, and beauty, and for voices not shouting to be heard.  This book chronicles some of what I’ve learned in what has become a conversation across time and generations, across disciplines and denominations.”   Peabody Award-winning broadcaster and National Humanities Medalist Krista Tippett has interviewed the most extraordinary voices examining the great questions of meaning for our time. The heart of her work on her national public radio program and podcast, On Being, has been to shine a light on people whose insights kindle in us a sense of wonder and courage. Scientists in a variety of fields; theologians from an array of faiths; poets, activists, and many others have all opened themselves up to Tippett's compassionate yet searching conversation.   In Becoming Wise, Tippett distills the insights she has gleaned from this luminous conversation in its many dimensions into a coherent narrative journey, over time and from mind to mind. The book is a master class in living, curated by Tippett and accompanied by a delightfully ecumenical dream team of teaching faculty.   The open questions and challenges of our time are intimate and civilizational all at once, Tippett says – definitions of when life begins and when death happens, of the meaning of community and family and identity, of our relationships to technology and through technology. The wisdom we seek emerges through the raw materials of the everyday. And the enduring question of what it means to be human has now become inextricable from the question of who we are to each other.   This book offers a grounded and fiercely hopeful vision of humanity for this century – of personal growth but also renewed public life and human spiritual evolution. It insists on the possibility of a common life for this century marked by resilience and redemption, with beauty as a core moral value and civility and love as muscular practice. Krista Tippett's great gift, in her work and in Becoming Wise, is to avoid reductive simplifications but still find the golden threads that weave people and ideas together into a shimmering braid.   One powerful common denominator of the lessons imparted to Tippett is the gift of presence, of the exhilaration of engagement with life for its own sake, not as a means to an end. But presence does not mean passivity or acceptance of the status quo. Indeed Tippett and her teachers are people whose work meets, and often drives, powerful forces of change alive in the world today. In the end, perhaps the greatest blessing conveyed by the lessons of spiritual genius Tippett harvests in Becoming Wise is the strength to meet the world where it really is, and then to make it better. ...more", i m a person who listens for a living i listen for wisdom and beauty and for voices not shouting to be heard this book chronicles some of what i ve learned in what has become a conversation across time and generations across disciplines and denominations peabody award winning broadcaster and national humanities medalist krista tippett has interviewed the most extr i m a person who listens for a living i listen for wisdom and beauty and for voices not shouting to be heard this book chronicles some of what i ve learned in what has become a conversation across time and generations across disciplines and denominations peabody award winning broadcaster and national humanities medalist krista tippett has interviewed the most extraordinary voices examining the great questions of meaning for our time the heart of her work on her national public radio program and podcast on being has been to shine a light on people whose insights kindle in us a sense of wonder and courage scientists in a variety of fields theologians from an array of faiths poets activists and many others have all opened themselves up to tippett s compassionate yet searching conversation in becoming wise tippett distills the insights she has gleaned from this luminous conversation in its many dimensions into a coherent narrative journey over time and from mind to mind the book is a master class in living curated by tippett and accompanied by a delightfully ecumenical dream team of teaching faculty the open questions and challenges of our time are intimate and civilizational all at once tippett says definitions of when life begins and when death happens of the meaning of community and family and identity of our relationships to technology and through technology the wisdom we seek emerges through the raw materials of the everyday and the enduring question of what it means to be human has now become inextricable from the question of who we are to each other this book offers a grounded and fiercely hopeful vision of humanity for this century of personal growth but also renewed public life and human spiritual evolution it insists on the possibility of a common life for this century marked by resilience and redemption with beauty as a core moral value and civility and love as muscular practice krista tippett s great gift in her work and in becoming wise is to avoid reductive simplifications but still find the golden threads that weave people and ideas together into a shimmering braid one powerful common denominator of the lessons imparted to tippett is the gift of presence of the exhilaration of engagement with life for its own sake not as a means to an end but presence does not mean passivity or acceptance of the status quo indeed tippett and her teachers are people whose work meets and often drives powerful forces of change alive in the world today in the end perhaps the greatest blessing conveyed by the lessons of spiritual genius tippett harvests in becoming wise is the strength to meet the world where it really is and then to make it better more,Unknown

One in four Americans reject any affiliation with organized religion, and nearly half of those under thirty describe themselves as “spiritual but not religious.” But as the airwaves resound with the haranguing of preachers and pundits, who speaks for the millions who find no joy in whittling the wonder of existence to a simple yes/no choice? Lesley Hazleton does. In this provocative, brilliant book, she gives voice to the case for agnosticism, breaks it free of its stereotypes as watered-down atheism or amorphous “seeking,” and celebrates it as a reasoned, revealing, and sustaining stance toward life. Stepping over the lines imposed by rigid conviction, she draws on philosophy, theology, psychology, science, and more to explore, with curiosity and passion, the vital role of mystery in a deceptively information-rich world; to ask what we mean by the search for meaning; to invoke the humbling yet elating perspective of infinity; to challenge received ideas about death; and to reconsider what “the soul” might be.

Scores of Jewish prophets, preachers, and would-be messiahs wandered through the Holy Land, bearing messages from God. This was the age of zealotry—a fervent nationalism that made resistance to the Roman occupation a sacred duty incumbent on all Jews. And few figures better exemplified this principle than the charismatic Galilean who defied both the imperial authorities and their allies in the Jewish religious hierarchy.Balancing the Jesus of the Gospels against the historical sources, Aslan describes a man full of conviction and passion, yet rife with contradiction; a man of peace who exhorted his followers to arm themselves with swords; an exorcist and faith healer who urged his disciples to keep his identity a secret; and ultimately the seditious “King of the Jews” whose promise of liberation from Rome went unfulfilled in his brief lifetime. Aslan explores the reasons why the early Christian church preferred to promulgate an image of Jesus as a peaceful spiritual teacher rather than a politically conscious revolutionary. And he grapples with the riddle of how Jesus understood himself, the mystery that is at the heart of all subsequent claims about his divinity.Zealot yields a fresh perspective on one of the greatest stories ever told even as it affirms the radical and transformative nature of Jesus of Nazareth’s life and mission. The result is a thought-provoking, elegantly written biography with the pulse of a fast-paced novel: a singularly brilliant portrait of a man, a time, and the birth of a religion. ...more",from the internationally bestselling author of no god but god comes a fascinating provocative and meticulously researched biography that challenges long held assumptions about the man we know as jesus of nazareth two thousand years ago an itinerant jewish preacher and miracle worker walked across the galilee gathering followers to establish what he called the kingdom from the internationally bestselling author of no god but god comes a fascinating provocative and meticulously researched biography that challenges long held assumptions about the man we know as jesus of nazareth two thousand years ago an itinerant jewish preacher and miracle worker walked across the galilee gathering followers to establish what he called the kingdom of god the revolutionary movement he launched was so threatening to the established order that he was captured tortured and executed as a state criminal within decades after his shameful death his followers would call him god sifting through centuries of mythmaking reza aslan sheds new light on one of history s most influential and enigmatic characters by examining jesus through the lens of the tumultuous era in which he lived first century palestine an age awash in apocalyptic fervor scores of jewish prophets preachers and would be messiahs wandered through the holy land bearing messages from god this was the age of zealotry a fervent nationalism that made resistance to the roman occupation a sacred duty incumbent on all jews and few figures better exemplified this principle than the charismatic galilean who defied both the imperial authorities and their allies in the jewish religious hierarchy balancing the jesus of the gospels against the historical sources aslan describes a man full of conviction and passion yet rife with contradiction a man of peace who exhorted his followers to arm themselves with swords an exorcist and faith healer who urged his disciples to keep his identity a secret and ultimately the seditious king of the jews whose promise of liberation from rome went unfulfilled in his brief lifetime aslan explores the reasons why the early christian church preferred to promulgate an image of jesus as a peaceful spiritual teacher rather than a politically conscious revolutionary and he grapples with the riddle of how jesus understood himself the mystery that is at the heart of all subsequent claims about his divinity zealot yields a fresh perspective on one of the greatest stories ever told even as it affirms the radical and transformative nature of jesus of nazareth s life and mission the result is a thought provoking elegantly written biography with the pulse of a fast paced novel a singularly brilliant portrait of a man a time and the birth of a religion more,Reza Aslan

Its core contention is that American conservatism and the Republican Party took a wrong turn when they adopted Barry Goldwater’s worldview during and after the 1964 campaign. The radicalism of today’s conservatism is not the product of the Tea Party, Washington Post columnist E.J. Dionne writes. The Tea Partiers are the true heirs to Goldwater ideology. The purity movement did more than drive moderates out of the Republican Party—it beat back alternative definitions of conservatism.Since 1968, no conservative administration—not Nixon not Reagan not two Bushes—could live up to the rhetoric rooted in the Goldwater movement that began to reshape American politics fifty years ago. The collapse of the Nixon presidency led to the rise of Ronald Reagan, the defeat of George H.W. Bush, to Newt Gingrich’s revolution. Bush initially undertook a partial modernization, preaching “compassionate conservatism” and a “Fourth Way” to Clinton’s “Third Way.” Conservatives quickly defined him as an advocate of “big government” and not conservative enough on spending, immigration, education, and Medicare. A return to the true faith was the only prescription on order. The result was the Tea Party, which Dionne says, was as much a reaction to Bush as to Obama.The state of the Republican party, controlled by the strictest base, is diminished, Dionne writes. It has become white and older in a country that is no longer that. It needs to come back to life for its own health and that of the country’s, and in Why the Right Went Wrong, he explains how. ...more", dionne s expertise is evident in this finely crafted and convincing work the los angeles timesfrom one of our most engaging political reporters and the author of why americans hate politics the story of conservatism from the goldwater s to the present day tea party that has resulted in broken promises and an ideological purity that drives moderate republicans away dionne s expertise is evident in this finely crafted and convincing work the los angeles timesfrom one of our most engaging political reporters and the author of why americans hate politics the story of conservatism from the goldwater s to the present day tea party that has resulted in broken promises and an ideological purity that drives moderate republicans away why the right went wrong offers a historical view of the right since the s its core contention is that american conservatism and the republican party took a wrong turn when they adopted barry goldwater s worldview during and after the campaign the radicalism of today s conservatism is not the product of the tea party washington post columnist e j dionne writes the tea partiers are the true heirs to goldwater ideology the purity movement did more than drive moderates out of the republican party it beat back alternative definitions of conservatism since no conservative administration not nixon not reagan not two bushes could live up to the rhetoric rooted in the goldwater movement that began to reshape american politics fifty years ago the collapse of the nixon presidency led to the rise of ronald reagan the defeat of george h w bush to newt gingrich s revolution bush initially undertook a partial modernization preaching compassionate conservatism and a fourth way to clinton s third way conservatives quickly defined him as an advocate of big government and not conservative enough on spending immigration education and medicare a return to the true faith was the only prescription on order the result was the tea party which dionne says was as much a reaction to bush as to obama the state of the republican party controlled by the strictest base is diminished dionne writes it has become white and older in a country that is no longer that it needs to come back to life for its own health and that of the country s and in why the right went wrong he explains how more,Unknown

Then, on the ocean surface, a face appeared. It was that of a young lieutenant, the plane’s bombardier, who was struggling to a life raft and pulling himself aboard. So began one of the most extraordinary odysseys of the Second World War.The lieutenant’s name was Louis Zamperini. In boyhood, he’d been a cunning and incorrigible delinquent, breaking into houses, brawling, and fleeing his home to ride the rails. As a teenager, he had channeled his defiance into running, discovering a prodigious talent that had carried him to the Berlin Olympics and within sight of the four-minute mile. But when war had come, the athlete had become an airman, embarking on a journey that led to his doomed flight, a tiny raft, and a drift into the unknown.Ahead of Zamperini lay thousands of miles of open ocean, leaping sharks, a foundering raft, thirst and starvation, enemy aircraft, and, beyond, a trial even greater. Driven to the limits of endurance, Zamperini would answer desperation with ingenuity; suffering with hope, resolve, and humor; brutality with rebellion. His fate, whether triumph or tragedy, would be suspended on the fraying wire of his will.In her long-awaited new book, Laura Hillenbrand writes with the same rich and vivid narrative voice she displayed in Seabiscuit. Telling an unforgettable story of a man’s journey into extremity, Unbroken is a testament to the resilience of the human mind, body, and spirit. ...more",on a may afternoon in an army air forces bomber crashed into the pacific ocean and disappeared leaving only a spray of debris and a slick of oil gasoline and blood then on the ocean surface a face appeared it was that of a young lieutenant the plane s bombardier who was struggling to a life raft and pulling himself aboard so began one of the most extraordin on a may afternoon in an army air forces bomber crashed into the pacific ocean and disappeared leaving only a spray of debris and a slick of oil gasoline and blood then on the ocean surface a face appeared it was that of a young lieutenant the plane s bombardier who was struggling to a life raft and pulling himself aboard so began one of the most extraordinary odysseys of the second world war the lieutenant s name was louis zamperini in boyhood he d been a cunning and incorrigible delinquent breaking into houses brawling and fleeing his home to ride the rails as a teenager he had channeled his defiance into running discovering a prodigious talent that had carried him to the berlin olympics and within sight of the four minute mile but when war had come the athlete had become an airman embarking on a journey that led to his doomed flight a tiny raft and a drift into the unknown ahead of zamperini lay thousands of miles of open ocean leaping sharks a foundering raft thirst and starvation enemy aircraft and beyond a trial even greater driven to the limits of endurance zamperini would answer desperation with ingenuity suffering with hope resolve and humor brutality with rebellion his fate whether triumph or tragedy would be suspended on the fraying wire of his will in her long awaited new book laura hillenbrand writes with the same rich and vivid narrative voice she displayed in seabiscuit telling an unforgettable story of a man s journey into extremity unbroken is a testament to the resilience of the human mind body and spirit more,K.

This is a stunning book of electric honesty and passion. Several days before Christmas 2003, John Gregory Dunne and Joan Didion saw their only daughter, Quintana, fall ill.At first they thought it was flu, then pneumonia, then complete septic shock.

But it would take the world some time to believe what had happened: the age of flight had begun, with the first heavier-than-air, powered machine carrying a pilot.Who were these men and how was it that they achieved what they did?David McCullough, two-time winner of the Pulitzer Prize, tells the surprising, profoundly American story of Wilbur and Orville Wright.Far more than a couple of unschooled Dayton bicycle mechanics who happened to hit on success, they were men of exceptional courage and determination, and of far-ranging intellectual interests and ceaseless curiosity, much of which they attributed to their upbringing. The house they lived in had no electricity or indoor plumbing, but there were books aplenty, supplied mainly by their preacher father, and they never stopped reading.When they worked together, no problem seemed to be insurmountable. Wilbur was unquestionably a genius. Orville had such mechanical ingenuity as few had ever seen. That they had no more than a public high school education, little money and no contacts in high places, never stopped them in their mission to take to the air. Nothing did, not even the self-evident reality that every time they took off in one of their contrivances, they risked being killed.In this thrilling book, master historian David McCullough draws on the immense riches of the Wright Papers, including private diaries, notebooks, scrapbooks, and more than a thousand letters from private family correspondence to tell the human side of the Wright Brothers' story, including the little-known contributions of their sister, Katharine, without whom things might well have gone differently for them. ...more",two time winner of the pulitzer prize david mccullough tells the dramatic story behind the story about the courageous brothers who taught the world how to fly wilbur and orville wright on a winter day in in the outer banks of north carolina two unknown brothers from ohio changed history but it would take the world some time to believe what had happened the age of two time winner of the pulitzer prize david mccullough tells the dramatic story behind the story about the courageous brothers who taught the world how to fly wilbur and orville wright on a winter day in in the outer banks of north carolina two unknown brothers from ohio changed history but it would take the world some time to believe what had happened the age of flight had begun with the first heavier than air powered machine carrying a pilot who were these men and how was it that they achieved what they did david mccullough two time winner of the pulitzer prize tells the surprising profoundly american story of wilbur and orville wright far more than a couple of unschooled dayton bicycle mechanics who happened to hit on success they were men of exceptional courage and determination and of far ranging intellectual interests and ceaseless curiosity much of which they attributed to their upbringing the house they lived in had no electricity or indoor plumbing but there were books aplenty supplied mainly by their preacher father and they never stopped reading when they worked together no problem seemed to be insurmountable wilbur was unquestionably a genius orville had such mechanical ingenuity as few had ever seen that they had no more than a public high school education little money and no contacts in high places never stopped them in their mission to take to the air nothing did not even the self evident reality that every time they took off in one of their contrivances they risked being killed in this thrilling book master historian david mccullough draws on the immense riches of the wright papers including private diaries notebooks scrapbooks and more than a thousand letters from private family correspondence to tell the human side of the wright brothers story including the little known contributions of their sister katharine without whom things might well have gone differently for them more,David McCullough

She has quit smoking, run a marathon, and been promoted at work. The patterns inside her brain, neurologists discover, have fundamentally changed. Marketers at Procter & Gamble study videos of people making their beds. They are desperately trying to figure out how to sell a new product called Febreze, on track to be one of the biggest flops in company history. Suddenly, one of them detects a nearly imperceptible pattern—and with a slight shift in advertising, Febreze goes on to earn a billion dollars a year. An untested CEO takes over one of the largest companies in America. His first order of business is attacking a single pattern among his employees—how they approach worker safety—and soon the firm, Alcoa, becomes the top performer in the Dow Jones. What do all these people have in common? They achieved success by focusing on the patterns that shape every aspect of our lives.  They succeeded by transforming habits. In The Power of Habit, award-winning New York Times business reporter Charles Duhigg takes us to the thrilling edge of scientific discoveries that explain why habits exist and how they can be changed. With penetrating intelligence and an ability to distill vast amounts of information into engrossing narratives, Duhigg brings to life a whole new understanding of human nature and its potential for transformation.  Along the way we learn why some people and companies struggle to change, despite years of trying, while others seem to remake themselves overnight. We visit laboratories where neuroscientists explore how habits work and where, exactly, they reside in our brains. We discover how the right habits were crucial to the success of Olympic swimmer Michael Phelps, Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz, and civil-rights hero Martin Luther King, Jr. We go inside Procter & Gamble, Target superstores, Rick Warren’s Saddleback Church, NFL locker rooms, and the nation’s largest hospitals and see how implementing so-called keystone habits can earn billions and mean the difference between failure and success, life and death. At its core, The Power of Habit contains an exhilarating argument: The key to exercising regularly, losing weight, raising exceptional children, becoming more productive, building revolutionary companies and social movements, and achieving success is understanding how habits work.  Habits aren’t destiny. As Charles Duhigg shows, by harnessing this new science, we can transform our businesses, our communities, and our lives. ...more",a young woman walks into a laboratory over the past two years she has transformed almost every aspect of her life she has quit smoking run a marathon and been promoted at work the patterns inside her brain neurologists discover have fundamentally changed marketers at procter gamble study videos of people making their beds they are desperately trying to figur a young woman walks into a laboratory over the past two years she has transformed almost every aspect of her life she has quit smoking run a marathon and been promoted at work the patterns inside her brain neurologists discover have fundamentally changed marketers at procter gamble study videos of people making their beds they are desperately trying to figure out how to sell a new product called febreze on track to be one of the biggest flops in company history suddenly one of them detects a nearly imperceptible pattern and with a slight shift in advertising febreze goes on to earn a billion dollars a year an untested ceo takes over one of the largest companies in america his first order of business is attacking a single pattern among his employees how they approach worker safety and soon the firm alcoa becomes the top performer in the dow jones what do all these people have in common they achieved success by focusing on the patterns that shape every aspect of our lives they succeeded by transforming habits in the power of habit award winning new york times business reporter charles duhigg takes us to the thrilling edge of scientific discoveries that explain why habits exist and how they can be changed with penetrating intelligence and an ability to distill vast amounts of information into engrossing narratives duhigg brings to life a whole new understanding of human nature and its potential for transformation along the way we learn why some people and companies struggle to change despite years of trying while others seem to remake themselves overnight we visit laboratories where neuroscientists explore how habits work and where exactly they reside in our brains we discover how the right habits were crucial to the success of olympic swimmer michael phelps starbucks ceo howard schultz and civil rights hero martin luther king jr we go inside procter gamble target superstores rick warren s saddleback church nfl locker rooms and the nation s largest hospitals and see how implementing so called keystone habits can earn billions and mean the difference between failure and success life and death at its core the power of habit contains an exhilarating argument the key to exercising regularly losing weight raising exceptional children becoming more productive building revolutionary companies and social movements and achieving success is understanding how habits work habits aren t destiny as charles duhigg shows by harnessing this new science we can transform our businesses our communities and our lives more,Unknown

Here, for the first time and in detail, Zimbardo tells the full story of the Stanford Prison Experiment, the landmark study in which a group of college-student volunteers was randomly divided into “guards” and “inmates” and then placed in a mock prison environment. Within a week, the study was abandoned, as ordinary college students were transformed into either brutal, sadistic guards or emotionally broken prisoners. By illuminating the psychological causes behind such disturbing metamorphoses, Zimbardo enables us to better understand a variety of harrowing phenomena, from corporate malfeasance to organized genocide to how once upstanding American soldiers came to abuse and torture Iraqi detainees in Abu Ghraib. He replaces the long-held notion of the “bad apple” with that of the “bad barrel”—the idea that the social setting and the system contaminate the individual, rather than the other way around. ...more",renowned social psychologist and creator of the stanford prison experiment philip zimbardo explores the mechanisms that make good people do bad things how moral people can be seduced into acting immorally and what this says about the line separating good from evil the lucifer effect explains how and the myriad reasons why we are all susceptible to the lure of the dar renowned social psychologist and creator of the stanford prison experiment philip zimbardo explores the mechanisms that make good people do bad things how moral people can be seduced into acting immorally and what this says about the line separating good from evil the lucifer effect explains how and the myriad reasons why we are all susceptible to the lure of the dark side drawing on examples from history as well as his own trailblazing research zimbardo details how situational forces and group dynamics can work in concert to make monsters out of decent men and women here for the first time and in detail zimbardo tells the full story of the stanford prison experiment the landmark study in which a group of college student volunteers was randomly divided into guards and inmates and then placed in a mock prison environment within a week the study was abandoned as ordinary college students were transformed into either brutal sadistic guards or emotionally broken prisoners by illuminating the psychological causes behind such disturbing metamorphoses zimbardo enables us to better understand a variety of harrowing phenomena from corporate malfeasance to organized genocide to how once upstanding american soldiers came to abuse and torture iraqi detainees in abu ghraib he replaces the long held notion of the bad apple with that of the bad barrel the idea that the social setting and the system contaminate the individual rather than the other way around more,Unknown

He infiltrates the most hostile countries in the world, defeats our enemies' advanced security measures, and eliminates threats before they ever reach our shores. But now, his skills have left him. Sent overseas on a critical assignment, he fails, unable to pull the trigger. Absent his talents, Robie is a man without a mission, and without a purpose.To recover what he has lost, Robie must confront what he has tried to forget for over twenty years: his own past. THE GUILTY Will Robie escaped his small Gulf Coast hometown of Cantrell, Mississippi after high school, severing all personal ties, and never looked back. Not once. Not until the unimaginable occurs. His father, Dan Robie, has been arrested and charged with murder.Father and son haven't spoken or seen each other since the day Robie left town. In that time, Dan Robie - a local attorney and pillar of the community-has been elected town judge. Despite this, most of Cantrell is aligned against Dan. His guilt is assumed.To make matters worse, Dan has refused to do anything to defend himself. When Robie tries to help, his father responds only with anger and defiance. Could Dan really be guilty?With the equally formidable Jessica Reel at his side, Robie ignores his father's wishes and begins his own desperate investigation into the case. But Robie is now a stranger to his hometown, an outsider, a man who has forsaken his past and his family. His attempts to save his father are met with distrust and skepticism . . . and violence.Unlike the missions Robie undertook in the service of his country, where his target was clearly defined, digging into his father's case only reveals more questions. Robie is drawn into the hidden underside of Cantrell, where he must face the unexpected and possibly deadly consequences of the long-ago choices made by father and son. And this time, there may be no escape for either of them. ...more",will robie is the government s most professional disciplined and lethal assassin he infiltrates the most hostile countries in the world defeats our enemies advanced security measures and eliminates threats before they ever reach our shores but now his skills have left him sent overseas on a critical assignment he fails unable to pull the trigger absent his tale will robie is the government s most professional disciplined and lethal assassin he infiltrates the most hostile countries in the world defeats our enemies advanced security measures and eliminates threats before they ever reach our shores but now his skills have left him sent overseas on a critical assignment he fails unable to pull the trigger absent his talents robie is a man without a mission and without a purpose to recover what he has lost robie must confront what he has tried to forget for over twenty years his own past the guilty will robie escaped his small gulf coast hometown of cantrell mississippi after high school severing all personal ties and never looked back not once not until the unimaginable occurs his father dan robie has been arrested and charged with murder father and son haven t spoken or seen each other since the day robie left town in that time dan robie a local attorney and pillar of the community has been elected town judge despite this most of cantrell is aligned against dan his guilt is assumed to make matters worse dan has refused to do anything to defend himself when robie tries to help his father responds only with anger and defiance could dan really be guilty with the equally formidable jessica reel at his side robie ignores his father s wishes and begins his own desperate investigation into the case but robie is now a stranger to his hometown an outsider a man who has forsaken his past and his family his attempts to save his father are met with distrust and skepticism and violence unlike the missions robie undertook in the service of his country where his target was clearly defined digging into his father s case only reveals more questions robie is drawn into the hidden underside of cantrell where he must face the unexpected and possibly deadly consequences of the long ago choices made by father and son and this time there may be no escape for either of them more,Unknown

The Bad-Ass Librarians of Timbuktu tells the incredible story of how Haidara, a mild-mannered archivist and historian from the legendary city of Timbuktu, later became one of the world’s greatest and most brazen smugglers.In 2012, thousands of Al Qaeda militants from northwest Africa seized control of most of Mali, including Timbuktu. They imposed Sharia law, chopped off the hands of accused thieves, stoned to death unmarried couples, and threatened to destroy the great manuscripts. As the militants tightened their control over Timbuktu, Haidara organized a dangerous operation to sneak all 350,000 volumes out of the city to the safety of southern Mali.Over the past twenty years, journalist Joshua Hammer visited Timbuktu numerous times and is uniquely qualified to tell the story of Haidara’s heroic and ultimately successful effort to outwit Al Qaeda and preserve Mali’s—and the world’s—literary patrimony. Hammer explores the city’s manuscript heritage and offers never-before-reported details about the militants’ march into northwest Africa.

Whether it's Horse meat in our burgers, melamine in our infant formula, artificial colors in our fish and fruit--as our urban lifestyle takes us farther away from our food sources, there are increasing opportunities for dishonesty, duplicity, and profit-making shortcuts. Food adulteration, motivated by money, is an issue that has spanned the globe throughout human history. Whether it's a matter of making a good quality oil stretch a bit further by adding a little extra ""something"" or labeling a food falsely to appeal to current consumer trends--it's all food fraud. Consumers may pay the ultimate costs for these crimes, with their health and, in some cases, their lives. So how do we sort the beef from the bull (or horse, as the case may be)?Illustrious analytical chemist Richard Evershed and science writer Nicola Temple explain the scientific tools and techniques that have revealed the century's biggest food fraud scams. They explore the arms race between scientists and adulterators as better techniques for detection spur more creative and sophisticated means of adulteration, and review the up-and-coming techniques and devices that will help the industry and consumers fight food fraud in the future.

He is a world-class hero, a larger-than-life figurehead, best known of a generation of astronauts whose achievements surged in just a few years from first man in space to first men on the moon. Now he pauses to reflect and share what he has learned, from the vantage point not only of outer space but also of time: still a non-stop traveler and impassioned advocate for space exploration, Aldrin will be 86 in 2016.  No Dream Is Too High whittles down Buzz Aldrin's event-filled life into a short list of principles he values, each illustrated by fascinating anecdotes and memories, such as: ·      Second comes right after first. NASA protocol should have meant he was first on the moon, but rules changed just before the mission. How he learned to be proud of being the second man on the moon. ·      Look for opportunities, not obstacles. Buzz was rejected the first time he applied to be an astronaut. Failure is an opportunity to learn to do better. ·      Always maintain your spirit of adventure. For his 80th birthday, Buzz went diving in the Galapagos and hitched a ride on a whale shark. He stays fit, energetic, and fascinated with life.  No Dream Is Too High is a beautiful memento, a thought-provoking set of ideas, and a new opportunity for Buzz Aldrin to connect with the masses of people who recognize his unique place in human history. ...more",beloved american hero buzz aldrin reflects on the wisdom guiding principles and irreverent anecdotes he s gathered through his event filled life both in outer space and on earth in this inspiring guide to life for the next generation everywhere he goes crowds gather to meet buzz aldrin he is a world class hero a larger than life figurehead best known of a generatio beloved american hero buzz aldrin reflects on the wisdom guiding principles and irreverent anecdotes he s gathered through his event filled life both in outer space and on earth in this inspiring guide to life for the next generation everywhere he goes crowds gather to meet buzz aldrin he is a world class hero a larger than life figurehead best known of a generation of astronauts whose achievements surged in just a few years from first man in space to first men on the moon now he pauses to reflect and share what he has learned from the vantage point not only of outer space but also of time still a non stop traveler and impassioned advocate for space exploration aldrin will be in no dream is too high whittles down buzz aldrin s event filled life into a short list of principles he values each illustrated by fascinating anecdotes and memories such as second comes right after first nasa protocol should have meant he was first on the moon but rules changed just before the mission how he learned to be proud of being the second man on the moon look for opportunities not obstacles buzz was rejected the first time he applied to be an astronaut failure is an opportunity to learn to do better always maintain your spirit of adventure for his th birthday buzz went diving in the galapagos and hitched a ride on a whale shark he stays fit energetic and fascinated with life no dream is too high is a beautiful memento a thought provoking set of ideas and a new opportunity for buzz aldrin to connect with the masses of people who recognize his unique place in human history more,Unknown

Meanwhile, people with important ideas–business people, teachers, politicians, journalists, and others–struggle to make their ideas “stick.” Why do some ideas thrive while others die? And how do we improve the chances of worthy ideas? In Made to Stick, accomplished educators and idea collectors Chip and Dan Heath tackle head-on these vexing questions. Inside, the brothers Heath reveal the anatomy of ideas that stick and explain ways to make ideas stickier, such as applying the “human scale principle,” using the “Velcro Theory of Memory,” and creating “curiosity gaps.”In this indispensable guide, we discover that sticky messages of all kinds–from the infamous “kidney theft ring” hoax to a coach’s lessons on sportsmanship to a vision for a new product at Sony–draw their power from the same six traits.Made to Stick is a book that will transform the way you communicate ideas.

In addition, Miranda has written more than 200 funny, revealing footnotes for his award-winning libretto, the full text of which is published here.Their account features photos by the renowned Frank Ockenfels and veteran Broadway photographer, Joan Marcus; exclusive looks at notebooks and emails; interviews with Questlove, Stephen Sond­heim, leading political commentators, and more than 50 people involved with the production; and multiple appearances by Presi­dent Obama himself.

Casting aside his love of elaborate character and town histories and penchant for delayed gratification, King yanks readers off their feet within the first few pages; dragging them into the fray and offering no chance catch their breath until the very last page. In Cell King taps into readers fears of technological warfare and terrorism.

Those without cell phones, like illustrator Clayton Riddell and his small band of ""normies,"" must fight for survival, and their journey to find Clayton's estranged wife and young son rockets the book toward resolution. Fans that have followed King from the beginning will recognize and appreciate Cell as a departure--King's writing has not been so pure of heart and free of hang-ups in years (wrapping up his phenomenal Dark Tower series and receiving a medal from the National Book Foundation doesn't hurt either).

Advertising no longer works. Weaned on TiVo, the Internet, and other emerging technologies, the short-attention-span generation has become immune to marketing. Consumers are “in control.” Or so we’re told.In Buying In, New York Times Magazine “Consumed” columnist Rob Walker argues that this accepted wisdom misses a much more important and lasting cultural shift. As technology has created avenues for advertising anywhere and everywhere, people are embracing brands more than ever before–creating brands of their own and participating in marketing campaigns for their favorite brands in unprecedented ways. Increasingly, motivated consumers are pitching in to spread the gospel virally, whether by creating Internet video ads for Converse All Stars or becoming word-of-mouth “agents” touting products to friends and family on behalf of huge corporations. In the process, they–we–have begun to funnel cultural, political, and community activities through connections with brands. Walker explores this changing cultural landscape–including a practice he calls “murketing,” blending the terms murky and marketing–by introducing us to the creative marketers, entrepreneurs, artists, and community organizers who have found a way to thrive within it. Using profiles of brands old and new, including Timberland, American Apparel, Pabst Blue Ribbon, Red Bull, iPod, and Livestrong, Walker demonstrates the ways in which buyers adopt products, not just as consumer choices, but as conscious expressions of their identities. Part marketing primer, part work of cultural anthropology, Buying In reveals why now, more than ever, we are what we buy–and vice versa. Praise for Buying In “Walker … makes a startling claim: Far from being immune to advertising, as many people think, American consumers are increasingly active participants in the marketing process. … [He] leads readers through a series of lucid case studies to demonstrate that, in many cases, consumers actively participate in infusing a brand with meaning. … Convincing.” — Jay Dixit, The Washington Post “Walker lays out his theory in well-written, entertaining detail.” — Seth Stevenson, Slate “Buying In delves into the attitudes of the global consumer in the age of plenty, and, well, we aren’t too pretty. Walker carries the reader on a frenetically paced tour of senseless consumption spanning from Viking ranges to custom high-tops.” — Robert Blinn, Core77 “Rob Walker is one smart shopper.” — Jen Trolio, ReadyMade “The most trenchant psychoanalyst of our consumer selves is Rob Walker. This is a fresh and fascinating exploration of the places where material culture and identity intersect.” –Michael Pollan, author of In Defense of Food “This book has vast social implications, far beyond the fields of marketing and branding. It obliterates our old paradigm of companies (the bad guys) corrupting our children (the innocents) via commercials. In this new world, media-literate young people freely and willingly co-opt the brands, and most companies are clueless bystanders desperate to keep up. I really don't know if this is good news or bad news, but I can say, with certainty, that this book is a must-read.”–Po Bronson, author of What Should I Do with My Life? “Rob Walker is a gift. He shows that in our shattered, scattered world, powerful brands are existential, insinuating themselves into the human questions ‘What am I about?’ and ‘How do I connect?’ His insight that brand influence is becoming both more pervasive and more hidden–that we are not so self-defined as we like to think–should make us disturbed, and vigilant.”–Jim Collins, author of Good to Great“Rob Walker is a terrific writer who understands both human nature and the business world. His book is highly entertaining, but it’s also a deeply thoughtful look at the ways in which marketing meets the modern psyche.”–Bethany McLean, editor at large, Fortune, and co-author of The Smartest Guys in the Room“Are we living in an era of YouTube-empowered, brand-rejecting consumers? Rob Walker has the surprising answers, and you won’t want to miss this joyride through the front lines of consumer culture.

No one was more stunned by this unexpected turn of events than its beloved editor in chief, Ruth Reichl, who suddenly faced an uncertain professional future. As she struggled to process what had seemed unthinkable, Reichl turned to the one place that had always provided sanctuary. “I did what I always do when I’m confused, lonely, or frightened,” she writes. “I disappeared into the kitchen.”My Kitchen Year follows the change of seasons—and Reichl’s emotions—as she slowly heals through the simple pleasures of cooking. While working 24/7, Reichl would “throw quick meals together” for her family and friends. Now she has the time to rediscover what cooking meant to her. Imagine kale, leaves dark and inviting, sautéed with chiles and garlic; summer peaches baked into a simple cobbler; fresh oysters chilling in a box of snow; plump chickens and earthy mushrooms, fricasseed with cream. Over the course of this challenging year, each dish Reichl prepares becomes a kind of stepping stone to finding joy again in ordinary things. The 136 recipes collected here represent a life’s passion for food: a blistering ma po tofu that shakes Reichl out of the blues; a decadent grilled cheese sandwich that accompanies a rare sighting in the woods around her home; a rhubarb sundae that signals the arrival of spring. Here, too, is Reichl’s enlivening dialogue with her Twitter followers, who become her culinary supporters and lively confidants. Part cookbook, part memoir, part paean to the household gods, My Kitchen Year may be Ruth Reichl’s most stirring book yet—one that reveals a refreshingly vulnerable side of the world's most famous food editor as she shares treasured recipes to be returned to again and again and again. ...more",new york times bestsellerin the fall of the food world was rocked when gourmet magazine was abruptly shuttered by its parent company no one was more stunned by this unexpected turn of events than its beloved editor in chief ruth reichl who suddenly faced an uncertain professional future as she struggled to process what had seemed unthinkable reichl turned to the new york times bestsellerin the fall of the food world was rocked when gourmet magazine was abruptly shuttered by its parent company no one was more stunned by this unexpected turn of events than its beloved editor in chief ruth reichl who suddenly faced an uncertain professional future as she struggled to process what had seemed unthinkable reichl turned to the one place that had always provided sanctuary i did what i always do when i m confused lonely or frightened she writes i disappeared into the kitchen my kitchen year follows the change of seasons and reichl s emotions as she slowly heals through the simple pleasures of cooking while working reichl would throw quick meals together for her family and friends now she has the time to rediscover what cooking meant to her imagine kale leaves dark and inviting saut ed with chiles and garlic summer peaches baked into a simple cobbler fresh oysters chilling in a box of snow plump chickens and earthy mushrooms fricasseed with cream over the course of this challenging year each dish reichl prepares becomes a kind of stepping stone to finding joy again in ordinary things the recipes collected here represent a life s passion for food a blistering ma po tofu that shakes reichl out of the blues a decadent grilled cheese sandwich that accompanies a rare sighting in the woods around her home a rhubarb sundae that signals the arrival of spring here too is reichl s enlivening dialogue with her twitter followers who become her culinary supporters and lively confidants part cookbook part memoir part paean to the household gods my kitchen year may be ruth reichl s most stirring book yet one that reveals a refreshingly vulnerable side of the world s most famous food editor as she shares treasured recipes to be returned to again and again and again more,Unknown

She hears escape.Once in France, April quickly learns the apartment is not merely some rich hoarder's repository. Beneath the cobwebs and stale perfumed air is a goldmine, and not because of the actual gold (or painted ostrich eggs or mounted rhinoceros horns or bronze bathtub). First, there's a portrait by one of the masters of the Belle Epoque, Giovanni Boldini. And then there are letters and journals written by the very woman in the painting, Marthe de Florian. These documents reveal that she was more than a renowned courtesan with enviable decolletage. Suddenly April's quest is no longer about the bureaux plats and Louis-style armchairs that will fetch millions at auction. It's about discovering the story behind this charismatic woman.It's about discovering two women, actually.With the help of a salty (and annoyingly sexy) Parisian solicitor and the courtesan's private diaries, April tries to uncover the many secrets buried in the apartment. As she digs into Marthe's life, April can't help but take a deeper look into her own. Having left behind in the States a cheating husband, a family crisis about to erupt, and a career she's been using as the crutch to simply get by, she feels compelled to sort out her own life too. When the things she left bubbling back home begin to boil over, and Parisian delicacies beyond flaky pâtisseries tempt her better judgment, April knows that both she and Marthe deserve happy finales.Whether accompanied by croissants or champagne, this delectable debut novel depicts the Paris of the Belle Epoque and the present day with vibrant and stunning allure. Based on historical events, Michelle Gable's A Paris Apartment will entertain and inspire, as readers embrace the struggles and successes of two very unforgettable women. ...more",bienvenue paris when april vogt s boss tells her about an apartment in the ninth arrondissement that has been discovered after being shuttered for the past seventy years the sotheby s continental furniture specialist does not hear the words dust or rats or decrepit she hears paris she hears escape once in france april quickly learns the apartment is not merely bienvenue paris when april vogt s boss tells her about an apartment in the ninth arrondissement that has been discovered after being shuttered for the past seventy years the sotheby s continental furniture specialist does not hear the words dust or rats or decrepit she hears paris she hears escape once in france april quickly learns the apartment is not merely some rich hoarder s repository beneath the cobwebs and stale perfumed air is a goldmine and not because of the actual gold or painted ostrich eggs or mounted rhinoceros horns or bronze bathtub first there s a portrait by one of the masters of the belle epoque giovanni boldini and then there are letters and journals written by the very woman in the painting marthe de florian these documents reveal that she was more than a renowned courtesan with enviable decolletage suddenly april s quest is no longer about the bureaux plats and louis style armchairs that will fetch millions at auction it s about discovering the story behind this charismatic woman it s about discovering two women actually with the help of a salty and annoyingly sexy parisian solicitor and the courtesan s private diaries april tries to uncover the many secrets buried in the apartment as she digs into marthe s life april can t help but take a deeper look into her own having left behind in the states a cheating husband a family crisis about to erupt and a career she s been using as the crutch to simply get by she feels compelled to sort out her own life too when the things she left bubbling back home begin to boil over and parisian delicacies beyond flaky p tisseries tempt her better judgment april knows that both she and marthe deserve happy finales whether accompanied by croissants or champagne this delectable debut novel depicts the paris of the belle epoque and the present day with vibrant and stunning allure based on historical events michelle gable s a paris apartment will entertain and inspire as readers embrace the struggles and successes of two very unforgettable women more,Michelle Gable

That willingness to speak her mind, stand her ground, and rattle the occasional cage has enabled this tough-talking girl from Brooklyn to forge an enduring and successful career in Hollywood. But being a troublemaker has come at a cost.That was never more evident than in 2013, when Remini loudly and publicly broke with the Church of Scientology. Now, in this frank, funny, poignant memoir, the former King of Queens star opens up about that experience for the first time, revealing the in-depth details of her painful split with the church and its controversial practices.Indoctrinated into the church as a child while living with her mother and sister in New York, Remini eventually moved to Los Angeles, where her dreams of becoming an actress and advancing Scientology’s causes grew increasingly intertwined. As an adult, she found the success she’d worked so hard for, and with it a prominent place in the hierarchy of celebrity Scientologists alongside people such as Tom Cruise, Scientology’s most high-profile adherent. Remini spent time directly with Cruise and was included among the guests at his 2006 wedding to Katie Holmes.But when she began to raise questions about some of the church’s actions, she found herself a target. In the end, she was declared by the church to be a threat to their organization and therefore a “Suppressive Person,” and as a result, all of her fellow parishioners—including members of her own family—were told to disconnect from her. Forever.Bold, brash, and bravely confessional, Troublemaker chronicles Leah Remini’s remarkable journey toward emotional and spiritual freedom, both for herself and for her family.

And this has profound consequences – on our health, our job performance, our relationships and our happiness. What is needed, she boldly asserts, is nothing short of a sleep revolution.  Only by renewing our relationship with sleep can we take back control of our lives.

The result is a sweeping, scientifically rigorous, and deeply personal exploration of sleep from all angles, from the history of sleep, to the role of dreams in our lives, to the consequences of sleep deprivation, and the new golden age of sleep science that is revealing the vital role sleep plays in our every waking moment and every aspect of our health – from weight gain, diabetes, and heart disease to cancer and Alzheimer’s.   In The Sleep Revolution, Arianna shows how our cultural dismissal of sleep as time wasted compromises our health and our decision-making and undermines our work lives, our personal lives -- and even our sex lives. She explores all the latest science on what exactly is going on while we sleep and dream.  She takes on the dangerous sleeping pill industry, and all the ways our addiction to technology disrupts our sleep. She also offers a range of recommendations and tips from leading scientists on how we can get better and more restorative sleep, and harness its incredible power.

It begins in the tiny Greenwich Village café where Smith goes every morning for black coffee, ruminates on the world as it is and the world as it was, and writes in her notebook. We then travel, through prose that shifts fluidly between dreams and reality, past and present, across a landscape of creative aspirations and inspirations: from Frida Kahlo's Casa Azul in Mexico, to a meeting of an Arctic explorer's society in Berlin; from the ramshackle seaside bungalow in New York's Far Rockaway that Smith buys just before Hurricane Sandy hits, to the graves of Genet, Plath, Rimbaud, and Mishima. Woven throughout are reflections on the writer's craft and on artistic creation, alongside signature memories including her life in Michigan with her husband, guitarist Fred Sonic Smith, whose untimely death was an irremediable loss. For it is loss, as well as the consolation we might salvage from it, that lies at the heart of this exquisitely told memoir, one augmented by stunning black-and-white Polaroids taken by Smith herself.

Anxiety. Chronic Pain. Phobias. Obsessive thoughts. The evidence is compelling: the roots of these difficulties may not reside in our immediate life experience or in chemical imbalances in our brains—but in the lives of our parents, grandparents, and even great-grandparents. The latest scientific research, now making headlines, supports what many have long intuited—that traumatic experience can be passed down through generations. It Didn’t Start with You builds on the work of leading experts in post-traumatic stress, including Mount Sinai School of Medicine neuroscientist Rachel Yehuda and psychiatrist Bessel van der Kolk, author of The Body Keeps the Score. Even if the person who suffered the original trauma has died, or the story has been forgotten or silenced, memory and feelings can live on. These emotional legacies are often hidden, encoded in everything from gene expression to everyday language, and they play a far greater role in our emotional and physical health than has ever before been understood.   As a pioneer in the field of inherited family trauma, Mark Wolynn has worked with individuals and groups on a therapeutic level for over twenty years. It Didn’t Start with You offers a pragmatic and prescriptive guide to his method, the Core Language Approach. Diagnostic self-inventories provide a way to uncover the fears and anxieties conveyed through everyday words, behaviors, and physical symptoms. Techniques for developing a genogram or extended family tree create a map of experiences going back through the generations. And visualization, active imagination, and direct dialogue create pathways to reconnection, integration, and reclaiming life and health. It Didn’t Start With You is a transformative approach to resolving longstanding difficulties that in many cases, traditional therapy, drugs, or other interventions have not had the capacity to touch. ...more",a groundbreaking approach to transforming traumatic legacies passed down in families over generations by an acclaimed expert in the field depression anxiety chronic pain phobias obsessive thoughts the evidence is compelling the roots of these difficulties may not reside in our immediate life experience or in chemical imbalances in our brains but in the lives of our a groundbreaking approach to transforming traumatic legacies passed down in families over generations by an acclaimed expert in the field depression anxiety chronic pain phobias obsessive thoughts the evidence is compelling the roots of these difficulties may not reside in our immediate life experience or in chemical imbalances in our brains but in the lives of our parents grandparents and even great grandparents the latest scientific research now making headlines supports what many have long intuited that traumatic experience can be passed down through generations it didn t start with you builds on the work of leading experts in post traumatic stress including mount sinai school of medicine neuroscientist rachel yehuda and psychiatrist bessel van der kolk author of the body keeps the score even if the person who suffered the original trauma has died or the story has been forgotten or silenced memory and feelings can live on these emotional legacies are often hidden encoded in everything from gene expression to everyday language and they play a far greater role in our emotional and physical health than has ever before been understood as a pioneer in the field of inherited family trauma mark wolynn has worked with individuals and groups on a therapeutic level for over twenty years it didn t start with you offers a pragmatic and prescriptive guide to his method the core language approach diagnostic self inventories provide a way to uncover the fears and anxieties conveyed through everyday words behaviors and physical symptoms techniques for developing a genogram or extended family tree create a map of experiences going back through the generations and visualization active imagination and direct dialogue create pathways to reconnection integration and reclaiming life and health it didn t start with you is a transformative approach to resolving longstanding difficulties that in many cases traditional therapy drugs or other interventions have not had the capacity to touch more,Unknown

Her s From the winner of 2014’s PEN Robert W. Bingham Prize, an unforgettable debut novel about Loretta, a teenager married off as a “sister wife,” who makes a break for freedom At the heart of this exciting debut novel, set in Arizona and Idaho in the mid-1970s, is fifteen-year-old Loretta, who slips out of her bedroom every evening to meet her so-called gentile boyfriend. Her strict Mormon parents catch her returning one night, and promptly marry her off to Dean Harder, a devout yet materialistic fundamentalist who already has a wife and a brood of kids. The Harders relocate to his native Idaho, where Dean’s teenage nephew Jason falls hard for Loretta. A Zeppelin and Tolkien fan, Jason worships Evel Knievel and longs to leave his close-minded community. He and Loretta make a break for it. They drive all night, stay in hotels, and relish their dizzying burst of teenage freedom as they seek to recover Dean’s cache of “Mormon gold.” But someone Loretta left behind is on their trail... A riveting story of desire and escape, Daredevils boasts memorable set pieces and a rich cast of secondary characters. There’s Dean’s other wife, Ruth, who as a child in the 1950s was separated from her parents during the notorious Short Creek raid, when federal agents descended on a Mormon fundamentalist community. There’s Jason’s best friend, Boyd, part Native American and caught up in the activist spirit of the time, who comes along for the ride, with disastrous results. And Vestal’s ultimate creation is a superbly sleazy chatterbox—a man who might or might not be Evel Knievel himself—who works his charms on Loretta at a casino in Elko, Nevada.A lifelong journalist whose Spokesman column is a fixture in Spokane, WA, Shawn has honed his fiction over many years, publishing in journals like McSweeney's and Tin House. His stunning first collection, Godforsaken Idaho, burrowed into history as it engaged with masculinity and crime, faith and apostasy, and the West that he knows so well. Daredevils shows what he can do on a broader canvas--a fascinating, wide-angle portrait of a time and place that's both a classic coming of age tale and a plunge into the myths of America, sacred and profane. ...more",from the winner of s pen robert w bingham prize an unforgettable debut novel about loretta a teenager married off as a sister wife who makes a break for freedomat the heart of this exciting debut novel set in arizona and idaho in the mid s is fifteen year old loretta who slips out of her bedroom every evening to meet her so called gentile boyfriend her s from the winner of s pen robert w bingham prize an unforgettable debut novel about loretta a teenager married off as a sister wife who makes a break for freedom at the heart of this exciting debut novel set in arizona and idaho in the mid s is fifteen year old loretta who slips out of her bedroom every evening to meet her so called gentile boyfriend her strict mormon parents catch her returning one night and promptly marry her off to dean harder a devout yet materialistic fundamentalist who already has a wife and a brood of kids the harders relocate to his native idaho where dean s teenage nephew jason falls hard for loretta a zeppelin and tolkien fan jason worships evel knievel and longs to leave his close minded community he and loretta make a break for it they drive all night stay in hotels and relish their dizzying burst of teenage freedom as they seek to recover dean s cache of mormon gold but someone loretta left behind is on their trail a riveting story of desire and escape daredevils boasts memorable set pieces and a rich cast of secondary characters there s dean s other wife ruth who as a child in the s was separated from her parents during the notorious short creek raid when federal agents descended on a mormon fundamentalist community there s jason s best friend boyd part native american and caught up in the activist spirit of the time who comes along for the ride with disastrous results and vestal s ultimate creation is a superbly sleazy chatterbox a man who might or might not be evel knievel himself who works his charms on loretta at a casino in elko nevada a lifelong journalist whose spokesman column is a fixture in spokane wa shawn has honed his fiction over many years publishing in journals like mcsweeney s and tin house his stunning first collection godforsaken idaho burrowed into history as it engaged with masculinity and crime faith and apostasy and the west that he knows so well daredevils shows what he can do on a broader canvas a fascinating wide angle portrait of a time and place that s both a classic coming of age tale and a plunge into the myths of america sacred and profane more,Rosemary Carter

It is a record of God's dealings with the ancient inhabitants of the Americas and contains, as does the Bible, the fullness of the everlasting gospel.The book was written by many ancient prophets by the spirit of prophecy and revelation. Their words, written on gold plates, were quoted and abridged by a prophet-historian named Mormon. The record gives an account of two great civilizations. One came from Jerusalem in 600 B.C., and afterward separated into two nations, known as the Nephites and the Lamanites. The other came much earlier when the Lord confounded the tongues at the Tower of Babel. This group is known as the Jaredites. After thousands of years, all were destroyed except the Lamanites, and they are among the ancestors of the American Indians. The crowning event recorded in the Book of Mormon is the personal ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ among the Nephites soon after his resurrection. It puts forth the doctrines of the gospel, outlines the plan of salvation, and tells men what they must do to gain peace in this life and eternal salvation in the life to come. After Mormon completed his writings, he delivered the account to his son Moroni, who added a few words of his own and hid up the plates in the hill Cumorah. On September 21, 1823, the same Moroni, then a glorified, resurrected being, appeared to the Prophet Joseph Smith and instructed him relative to the ancient record and its destined translation into the English language. In due course the plates were delivered to Joseph Smith, who translated them by the gift and power of God. The record is now published in many languages as a new and additional witness that Jesus Christ is the Son of the living God and that all who will come unto him and obey the laws and ordinances of his gospel may be saved. Concerning this record the Prophet Joseph Smith said: ""I told the brethren that the Book of Mormon was the most correct of any book on earth, and the keystone of our religion, and a man would get nearer to God by abiding by its precepts, than by any other book."" In addition to Joseph Smith, the Lord provided for eleven others to see the gold plates for themselves and to be special witnesses of the truth and divinity of the Book of Mormon. Their written testimonies are included herewith as ""The Testimony of Three Witnesses"" and ""The Testimony of Eight Witnesses."" We invite all men everywhere to read the Book of Mormon, to ponder in their hearts the message it contains, and the to ask God, the Eternal Father, in the name of Christ if the book is true.

As life in the real world becomes more and more scarce, and a strange illness starts spreading throughout the population, a young woman named Misha finds herself drawn deep into the true nature of a sinister company called SciTech.• In The IV Club, a new extracurricular group forms at Glenwood High.

They all feel strongly about who or what they think God is, why things happen the way they do, and what will become of us in the future. They question, praise and criticize God in the hopes of better understanding themselves and others. In a world challenged by economic issues, climate change, war, and constant threat of terrorism, people are pausing from their daily routines to ask the deeper questions and wonder about the divine and mysterious nature of their Creator.In this book, author and spiritual seeker Mare Cromwell interviews people from all walks of life, asking, “If I gave you God’s phone number, what would you do with it?” This spiritual memoir, framed by twenty-one interviews with people from all walks of life, combines the oral tradition of Studs Terkel with the soulful searchings of Neale Donald Welsh. If I gave you God’s phone number… offers the reader what only the best books offer—windows into the most authentic reaches of the soul. Cromwell’s conscientious selection of interview subjects, and her deft questioning, which presses them to go deeper and deeper, is what lends the book its striking range. This diorama of spiritual postures—some passionate, some highly intellectualized—is impossible to look away from, infects the reader with a fever of curiosity about the human condition, and then proceeds to administer the careful cure: vivid, compelling testimony. Not only do her many subjects nourish the reader by their telling, but Cromwell too provides ongoing doses of self-revelation, a gesture of honesty that unifies and strengthens the whole picture. Reading If I gave you God’s phone number…. will enrich your view of spiritual life—in all its radiant variety—forever.What people are saying about If I gave you God’s phone number…""I strongly recommend this engaging, thought-provoking book. It is distinguished by Ms. Cromwell's empathy for the interesting and diverse people she searched out to interview about their communication with God. Readers will be stimulated to reflect on their own spiritual journey as well as the author's own experiences and those of the people she has interviewed. Because of Ms. Cromwell's personal candor and insights, I continue to ponder the central question she asked her interviewees in this important and unusual book."" –James Crowfoot, Ph.D., Professor and Dean Emeritus, University of Michigan and former President of Antioch College“Mare Cromwell has done a wonderful job of bringing people's personal views on God and spirituality to the public in this book. These stories will deepen our understanding of the diversity of spirituality in the human experience.”–Garrett Sarley, President of the Omega Institute, author of ""The Essentials of Yoga"" and ""Walking Yoga""ABOUT THE AUTHOR: Mare Cromwell is an author, poet, gardener and environmentalist. A spiritual seeker for many years, she received a Masters in Natural Resources from the University of Michigan and worked internationally before starting this book. Seven years of interviewing along with a personal intensive search for spiritual meaning culminated in this treatise.

Ordinary art means something like: all art not made by Mozart. After all, art is rarely made by Mozart-like people; essentially—statistically speaking—there aren't any people like that. Geniuses get made once-a-century or so, yet good art gets made all the time, so to equate the making of art with the workings of genius removes this intimately human activity to a strangely unreachable and unknowable place. For all practical purposes making art can be examined in great detail without ever getting entangled in the very remote problems of genius.""—-from the IntroductionArt & Fear explores the way art gets made, the reasons it often doesn't get made, and the nature of the difficulties that cause so many artists to give up along the way. The book's co-authors, David Bayles and Ted Orland, are themselves both working artists, grappling daily with the problems of making art in the real world. Their insights and observations, drawn from personal experience, provide an incisive view into the world of art as it is expeienced by artmakers themselves.This is not your typical self-help book. This is a book written by artists, for artists -— it's about what it feels like when artists sit down at their easel or keyboard, in their studio or performance space, trying to do the work they need to do. First published in 1994, Art & Fear quickly became an underground classic. Word-of-mouth response alone—now enhanced by internet posting—has placed it among the best-selling books on artmaking and creativity nationally.Art & Fear has attracted a remarkably diverse audience, ranging from beginning to accomplished artists in every medium, and including an exceptional concentration among students and teachers.

The melody and night terrors she thought she’d left behind return with a vengeance, threatening to ruin her fragile version of normalcy. Then an unlikely ally tells her that she isn’t alone. That there are others just like her, fighting to hide their own shocking truths from coming to light. That they know who she is, and what she’s been through. Now, accompanied by four other girls, Lilix discovers her nightmares are larger than a single trauma; they’re a window to a hidden part of her soul, a place of immense power with a destiny that cannot be ignored.

She has written to say she is in hospice and wanted to say goodbye. Leaving his tense, bitter wife Maureen to her chores, Harold intends a quick walk to the corner mailbox to post his reply but instead, inspired by a chance encounter, he becomes convinced he must deliver his message in person to Queenie--who is 600 miles away--because as long as he keeps walking, Harold believes that Queenie will not die.

Between 1942 and 1945, Frankl labored in four different camps, including Auschwitz, while his parents, brother, and pregnant wife perished. Based on his own experience and the experiences of others he treated later in his practice, Frankl argues that we cannot avoid suffering, but we can choose how to cope with it, find meaning in it, and move forward with renewed purpose. Frankl's theory--known as logotherapy, from the Greek word logos (""meaning"")--holds that our primary drive in life is not pleasure, as Freud maintained, but the discovery and pursuit of what we personally find meaningful.At the time of Frankl's death in 1997, Man's Search for Meaning had sold more than 10 million copies in twenty-four languages.

His surprising journey illuminates not only our understanding of this immensely troubled, misunderstood, and complicated soul genius but the ways in which our cultural heritage has been shaped by Brown’s legacy. Kill ’Em National Book Award winner James McBride goes in search of the “real” James Brown after receiving a tip that promises to uncover the man behind the myth. His surprising journey illuminates not only our understanding of this immensely troubled, misunderstood, and complicated soul genius but the ways in which our cultural heritage has been shaped by Brown’s legacy.  Kill ’Em and Leave is more than a book about James Brown. Brown’s rough-and-tumble life, through McBride’s lens, is an unsettling metaphor for American life: the tension between North and South, black and white, rich and poor. McBride’s travels take him to forgotten corners of Brown’s never-before-revealed history: the country town where Brown’s family and thousands of others were displaced by America’s largest nuclear power bomb-making facility; a South Carolina field where a long-forgotten cousin recounts, in the dead of night, a fuller history of Brown’s sharecropping childhood, which until now has been a mystery. McBride seeks out the American expatriate in England who co-created the James Brown sound, visits the trusted right-hand manager who worked with Brown for forty-one years, and interviews Brown’s most influential nonmusical creation, his “adopted son,” the Reverend Al Sharpton. He describes the stirring visit of Michael Jackson to the Augusta, Georgia, funeral home where the King of Pop sat up all night with the body of his musical godfather, spends hours talking with Brown’s first wife, and lays bare the Dickensian legal contest over James Brown’s estate, a fight that has consumed careers; prevented any money from reaching the poor schoolchildren in Georgia and South Carolina, as instructed in his will; cost Brown’s estate millions in legal fees; and left James Brown’s body to lie for more than eight years in a gilded coffin in his daughter’s yard in South Carolina.   James McBride is one of the most distinctive and electric literary voices in America today, and part of the pleasure of his narrative is being in his presence, coming to understand Brown through McBride’s own insights as a black musician with Southern roots. Kill ’Em and Leave is a song unearthing and celebrating James Brown’s great legacy: the cultural landscape of America today.Praise for Kill ’Em and Leave “The definitive look at one of the greatest, most important entertainers, The Godfather, Da Number One Soul Brother, Mr. Please, Please Himself—JAMES BROWN.”—Spike Lee “Please, please, please: Can anybody tell us who and what was James Brown?

These were questions John Vassos asked when the Radio Corporation of America (RCA) asked him to design the first mass-produced television receiver, the TRK-12, which had its spectacular premier at the 1939 New York World’s Fair. Vassos emigrated from Greece and arrived in the United States in 1918. His career spans the evolution of central forms of mass media in the twentieth century and offers a template for understanding their success. This is Vassos’s legacy—shaping the way we interact with our media technologies. Other industrial designers may be more celebrated, but none were more focused on making radio and television attractive and accessible to millions of Americans.In John Vassos: Industrial Design for Modern Life, Danielle Shapiro is the first to examine the life and work of RCA’s key consultant designer through the rise of radio and television and into the computer era. Vassos conceived a vision for the look of new technologies still with us today. A founder of the Industrial Designers Society of America, he was instrumental in the development of a self-conscious industrial design profession during the late 1920s and 1930s and into the postwar period. Drawing on unpublished records and correspondence, Shapiro creates a portrait of a designer whose early artistic work in books like Phobia and Contempo critiqued the commercialization of modern life but whose later design work sought to accommodate it.Replete with rich behind-the-product stories of America’s design culture in the 1930s through the 1950s, this volume also chronicles the emergence of what was to become the nation’s largest media company and provides a fascinating glimpse into its early corporate culture. In our current era of watching TV on an iPod or a smartphone, Shapiro stimulates broad discussions of the meaning of technological design for mass media in daily life. ...more",what should a television look like how should a dial on a radio feel to the touch these were questions john vassos asked when the radio corporation of america rca asked him to design the first mass produced television receiver the trk which had its spectacular premier at the new york world s fair vassos emigrated from greece and arrived in the united states what should a television look like how should a dial on a radio feel to the touch these were questions john vassos asked when the radio corporation of america rca asked him to design the first mass produced television receiver the trk which had its spectacular premier at the new york world s fair vassos emigrated from greece and arrived in the united states in his career spans the evolution of central forms of mass media in the twentieth century and offers a template for understanding their success this is vassos s legacy shaping the way we interact with our media technologies other industrial designers may be more celebrated but none were more focused on making radio and television attractive and accessible to millions of americans in john vassos industrial design for modern life danielle shapiro is the first to examine the life and work of rca s key consultant designer through the rise of radio and television and into the computer era vassos conceived a vision for the look of new technologies still with us today a founder of the industrial designers society of america he was instrumental in the development of a self conscious industrial design profession during the late s and s and into the postwar period drawing on unpublished records and correspondence shapiro creates a portrait of a designer whose early artistic work in books like phobia and contempo critiqued the commercialization of modern life but whose later design work sought to accommodate it replete with rich behind the product stories of america s design culture in the s through the s this volume also chronicles the emergence of what was to become the nation s largest media company and provides a fascinating glimpse into its early corporate culture in our current era of watching tv on an ipod or a smartphone shapiro stimulates broad discussions of the meaning of technological design for mass media in daily life more,Unknown

In Eugene's fictive universe, veterans too damaged to be enfolded stalk the American heartland, reenacting atrocities on civilians and evading the Psych Corps, a federal agency dedicated to upholding the mental hygiene of the nation by any means necessary.This alternative America, in which a veteran tries to reimagine a damaged world, is the subject of Hystopia, the long-awaited first novel by David Means.

The result of genetic experimentation, Ender may be the military genius Earth desperately needs in a war against an alien enemy seeking to destroy all human life. The only way to find out is to throw Ender into ever harsher training, to chip away and find the diamond inside, or destroy him utterly. Ender Wiggin is six years old when it begins. He will grow up fast.But Ender is not the only result of the experiment. The war with the Buggers has been raging for a hundred years, and the quest for the perfect general has been underway almost as long. Ender's two older siblings, Peter and Valentine, are every bit as unusual as he is, but in very different ways. While Peter was too uncontrollably violent, Valentine very nearly lacks the capability for violence altogether. Neither was found suitable for the military's purpose. But they are driven by their jealousy of Ender, and by their inbred drive for power. Peter seeks to control the political process, to become a ruler. Valentine's abilities turn more toward the subtle control of the beliefs of commoner and elite alike, through powerfully convincing essays.

The sheer number of citizen scientists, combined with new technology, has begun to shape how research is conducted. Non-professionals become acknowledged experts: dentists turn into astronomers and accountants into botanists.Diary of a Citizen Scientist is a timely exploration of this phenomenon, told through the lens of nature writer Sharman Apt Russell’s yearlong study of a little-known species, the Western red-bellied tiger beetle. In a voice both humorous and lyrical, Russell recounts her persistent and joyful tracking of an insect she calls “charismatic,” “elegant,” and “fierce.” Patrolling the Gila River in southwestern New Mexico, collector’s net in hand, she negotiates the realities of climate change even as she celebrates the beauty of a still-wild and rural landscape.Russell’s self-awareness—of her occasionally-misplaced confidence, her quest to fill in “that blank spot on the map of tiger beetles,” and her desire to become newly engaged in her life—creates a portrait not only of the tiger beetle she tracks, but of the mindset behind self-driven scientific inquiry. Falling in love with the diversity of citizen science, she participates in crowdsourcing programs that range from cataloguing galaxies to monitoring the phenology of native plants, applauds the growing role of citizen science in environmental activism, and marvels at the profusion of projects around the world.Diary of a Citizen Scientist offers its readers a glimpse into the transformative properties of citizen science—and documents the transformation of the field as a whole. ...more",in the exploding world of citizen science hundreds of thousands of volunteers are monitoring climate change tracking bird migration finding stardust for nasa and excavating mastodons the sheer number of citizen scientists combined with new technology has begun to shape how research is conducted non professionals become acknowledged experts dentists turn into astro in the exploding world of citizen science hundreds of thousands of volunteers are monitoring climate change tracking bird migration finding stardust for nasa and excavating mastodons the sheer number of citizen scientists combined with new technology has begun to shape how research is conducted non professionals become acknowledged experts dentists turn into astronomers and accountants into botanists diary of a citizen scientist is a timely exploration of this phenomenon told through the lens of nature writer sharman apt russell s yearlong study of a little known species the western red bellied tiger beetle in a voice both humorous and lyrical russell recounts her persistent and joyful tracking of an insect she calls charismatic elegant and fierce patrolling the gila river in southwestern new mexico collector s net in hand she negotiates the realities of climate change even as she celebrates the beauty of a still wild and rural landscape russell s self awareness of her occasionally misplaced confidence her quest to fill in that blank spot on the map of tiger beetles and her desire to become newly engaged in her life creates a portrait not only of the tiger beetle she tracks but of the mindset behind self driven scientific inquiry falling in love with the diversity of citizen science she participates in crowdsourcing programs that range from cataloguing galaxies to monitoring the phenology of native plants applauds the growing role of citizen science in environmental activism and marvels at the profusion of projects around the world diary of a citizen scientist offers its readers a glimpse into the transformative properties of citizen science and documents the transformation of the field as a whole more,Unknown

Beginning with ""Boston Light,"" America’s first lighthouse, Dolin shows how the story of America, from colony to regional backwater, to fledging nation, and eventually to global industrial power, can be illustrated through its lighthouses.Even in the colonial era, the question of how best to solve the collective problem of lighting our ports, reefs, and coasts through a patchwork of private interests and independent localities telegraphed the great American debate over federalism and the role of a centralized government. As the nation expanded, throughout the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, so too did the coastlines in need of illumination, from New England to the Gulf of Mexico, the Great Lakes, the Pacific Coast all the way to Alaska. In Dolin's hands we see how each of these beacons tell its own story of political squabbling, technological advancement, engineering marvel, and individual derring-do.In rollicking detail, Dolin treats readers to a memorable cast of characters, from the penny-pinching Treasury official Stephen Pleasonton, who hamstrung the country's efforts to adopt the revolutionary Fresnel lens, to the indomitable Katherine Walker, who presided so heroically over New York Harbor as keeper at Robbins Reef Lighthouse that she was hailed as a genuine New York City folk hero upon her death in 1931. He also animates American military history from the Revolution to the Civil War and presents tales both humorous and harrowing of soldiers, saboteurs, Civil War battles, ruthless egg collectors, and, most important, the lighthouse keepers themselves, men and women who often performed astonishing acts of heroism in carrying out their duties.In the modern world of GPS and satellite-monitored shipping lanes, Brilliant Beacons forms a poignant elegy for the bygone days of the lighthouse, a symbol of American ingenuity that served as both a warning and a sign of hope for generations of mariners; and it also shows how these sentinels have endured, retaining their vibrancy to the present day. Containing over 150 photographs and illustrations, Brilliant Beacons vividly reframes America's history. ...more",set against the backdrop of an expanding nation brilliant beaconstraces the evolution of america s lighthouse system from its earliest days highlighting the political military and technological battles fought to illuminate the nation s hardscrabble coastlines beginning with boston light america s first lighthouse dolin shows how the story of america from colony to set against the backdrop of an expanding nation brilliant beacons traces the evolution of america s lighthouse system from its earliest days highlighting the political military and technological battles fought to illuminate the nation s hardscrabble coastlines beginning with boston light america s first lighthouse dolin shows how the story of america from colony to regional backwater to fledging nation and eventually to global industrial power can be illustrated through its lighthouses even in the colonial era the question of how best to solve the collective problem of lighting our ports reefs and coasts through a patchwork of private interests and independent localities telegraphed the great american debate over federalism and the role of a centralized government as the nation expanded throughout the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries so too did the coastlines in need of illumination from new england to the gulf of mexico the great lakes the pacific coast all the way to alaska in dolin s hands we see how each of these beacons tell its own story of political squabbling technological advancement engineering marvel and individual derring do in rollicking detail dolin treats readers to a memorable cast of characters from the penny pinching treasury official stephen pleasonton who hamstrung the country s efforts to adopt the revolutionary fresnel lens to the indomitable katherine walker who presided so heroically over new york harbor as keeper at robbins reef lighthouse that she was hailed as a genuine new york city folk hero upon her death in he also animates american military history from the revolution to the civil war and presents tales both humorous and harrowing of soldiers saboteurs civil war battles ruthless egg collectors and most important the lighthouse keepers themselves men and women who often performed astonishing acts of heroism in carrying out their duties in the modern world of gps and satellite monitored shipping lanes brilliant beacons forms a poignant elegy for the bygone days of the lighthouse a symbol of american ingenuity that served as both a warning and a sign of hope for generations of mariners and it also shows how these sentinels have endured retaining their vibrancy to the present day containing over photographs and illustrations brilliant beacons vividly reframes america s history more,Unknown

A “This is your country, this is your world, this is your body, and you must find some way to live within the all of it.”In a profound work that pivots from the biggest questions about American history and ideals to the most intimate concerns of a father for his son, Ta-Nehisi Coates offers a powerful new framework for understanding our nation’s history and current crisis. Americans have built an empire on the idea of “race,” a falsehood that damages us all but falls most heavily on the bodies of black women and men—bodies exploited through slavery and segregation, and, today, threatened, locked up, and murdered out of all proportion. What is it like to inhabit a black body and find a way to live within it? And how can we all honestly reckon with this fraught history and free ourselves from its burden?  Between the World and Me is Ta-Nehisi Coates’s attempt to answer these questions in a letter to his adolescent son. Coates shares with his son—and readers—the story of his awakening to the truth about his place in the world through a series of revelatory experiences, from Howard University to Civil War battlefields, from the South Side of Chicago to Paris, from his childhood home to the living rooms of mothers whose children’s lives were taken as American plunder. Beautifully woven from personal narrative, reimagined history, and fresh, emotionally charged reportage, Between the World and Me clearly illuminates the past, bracingly confronts our present, and offers a transcendent vision for a way forward. ...more", this is your country this is your world this is your body and you must find some way to live within the all of it in a profound work that pivots from the biggest questions about american history and ideals to the most intimate concerns of a father for his son ta nehisi coates offers a powerful new framework for understanding our nation s history and current crisis a this is your country this is your world this is your body and you must find some way to live within the all of it in a profound work that pivots from the biggest questions about american history and ideals to the most intimate concerns of a father for his son ta nehisi coates offers a powerful new framework for understanding our nation s history and current crisis americans have built an empire on the idea of race a falsehood that damages us all but falls most heavily on the bodies of black women and men bodies exploited through slavery and segregation and today threatened locked up and murdered out of all proportion what is it like to inhabit a black body and find a way to live within it and how can we all honestly reckon with this fraught history and free ourselves from its burden between the world and me is ta nehisi coates s attempt to answer these questions in a letter to his adolescent son coates shares with his son and readers the story of his awakening to the truth about his place in the world through a series of revelatory experiences from howard university to civil war battlefields from the south side of chicago to paris from his childhood home to the living rooms of mothers whose children s lives were taken as american plunder beautifully woven from personal narrative reimagined history and fresh emotionally charged reportage between the world and me clearly illuminates the past bracingly confronts our present and offers a transcendent vision for a way forward more,Ta-Nehisi Coates

But in the inevitable condition of aging and death, the goals of medicine seem too frequently to run counter to the interest of the human spirit.

Lauded as the most articulate voice of American freedom and equality, even as he held people—including his own family—in bondage, Jefferson is variably described as a hypocrite, an atheist, or a simple-minded proponent of li Thomas Jefferson is often portrayed as a hopelessly enigmatic figure—a riddle—a man so riven with contradictions that he is almost impossible to know. Lauded as the most articulate voice of American freedom and equality, even as he held people—including his own family—in bondage, Jefferson is variably described as a hypocrite, an atheist, or a simple-minded proponent of limited government who expected all Americans to be farmers forever.Now, Annette Gordon-Reed teams up with America's leading Jefferson scholar, Peter S. Onuf, to present an absorbing and revealing character study that dispels the many clichés that have accrued over the years about our third president. Challenging the widely prevalent belief that Jefferson remains so opaque as to be unknowable, the authors—through their careful analysis, painstaking research, and vivid prose—create a portrait of Jefferson, as he might have painted himself, one ""comprised of equal parts sun and shadow"" (Jane Kamensky).Tracing Jefferson's philosophical development from youth to old age, the authors explore what they call the ""empire"" of Jefferson's imagination—an expansive state of mind born of his origins in a slave society, his intellectual influences, and the vaulting ambition that propelled him into public life as a modern avatar of the Enlightenment who, at the same time, likened himself to a figure of old—""the most blessed of the patriarchs."" Indeed, Jefferson saw himself as a ""patriarch,"" not just to his country and mountain-like home at Monticello but also to his family, the white half that he loved so publicly, as well as to the black side that he claimed to love, a contradiction of extraordinary historical magnitude.Divided into three sections, ""Most Blessed of the Patriarchs"" reveals a striking personal dimension to his life. Part I, ""Patriarch,"" explores Jeffersons's origins in Virgina; Part II, "" 'Traveller,' "" covers his five-year sojourn to Paris; and Part III, ""Enthusiast,"" delves insightfully into the Virginian's views on Christianity, slavery, and race. We see not just his ideas and vision of America but come to know him in an almost familial way, such as through the importance of music in his life.""Most Blessed of the Patriarchs"" fundamentally challenges much of what we’ve come to accept about Jefferson, neither hypocrite nor saint, atheist nor fundamentalist. Gordon-Reed and Onuf, through a close reading of Jefferson’s own words, reintroduce us all to our most influential founding father: a man more gifted than most, but complicated in just the ways we all are. ...more",thomas jefferson is often portrayed as a hopelessly enigmatic figure a riddle a man so riven with contradictions that he is almost impossible to know lauded as the most articulate voice of american freedom and equality even as he held people including his own family in bondage jefferson is variably described as a hypocrite an atheist or a simple minded proponent of li thomas jefferson is often portrayed as a hopelessly enigmatic figure a riddle a man so riven with contradictions that he is almost impossible to know lauded as the most articulate voice of american freedom and equality even as he held people including his own family in bondage jefferson is variably described as a hypocrite an atheist or a simple minded proponent of limited government who expected all americans to be farmers forever now annette gordon reed teams up with america s leading jefferson scholar peter s onuf to present an absorbing and revealing character study that dispels the many clich s that have accrued over the years about our third president challenging the widely prevalent belief that jefferson remains so opaque as to be unknowable the authors through their careful analysis painstaking research and vivid prose create a portrait of jefferson as he might have painted himself one comprised of equal parts sun and shadow jane kamensky tracing jefferson s philosophical development from youth to old age the authors explore what they call the empire of jefferson s imagination an expansive state of mind born of his origins in a slave society his intellectual influences and the vaulting ambition that propelled him into public life as a modern avatar of the enlightenment who at the same time likened himself to a figure of old the most blessed of the patriarchs indeed jefferson saw himself as a patriarch not just to his country and mountain like home at monticello but also to his family the white half that he loved so publicly as well as to the black side that he claimed to love a contradiction of extraordinary historical magnitude divided into three sections most blessed of the patriarchs reveals a striking personal dimension to his life part i patriarch explores jeffersons s origins in virgina part ii traveller covers his five year sojourn to paris and part iii enthusiast delves insightfully into the virginian s views on christianity slavery and race we see not just his ideas and vision of america but come to know him in an almost familial way such as through the importance of music in his life most blessed of the patriarchs fundamentally challenges much of what we ve come to accept about jefferson neither hypocrite nor saint atheist nor fundamentalist gordon reed and onuf through a close reading of jefferson s own words reintroduce us all to our most influential founding father a man more gifted than most but complicated in just the ways we all are more,Unknown

Jacobs decides to dive in headfirst and attempt to obey the Bible as literally as possible for one full year. He vows to follow the Ten Commandments. To be fruitful and multiply. To love his neighbor. But also to obey the hundreds of less publicized rules: to avoid wearing clothes made of mixed fibers; to play a ten-string harp; to stone adulterers.The resulting spiritual journey is at once funny and profound, reverent and irreverent, personal and universal and will make you see history's most influential book with new eyes.Jacobs's quest transforms his life even more radically than the year spent reading the entire ""Encyclopedia Britannica"" for ""The Know-It-All."" His beard grows so unruly that he is regularly mistaken for a member of ZZ Top. He immerses himself in prayer, tends sheep in the Israeli desert, battles idolatry, and tells the absolute truth in all situations - much to his wife's chagrin.Throughout the book, Jacobs also embeds himself in a cross-section of communities that take the Bible literally. He tours a Kentucky-based creationist museum and sings hymns with Pennsylvania Amish. He dances with Hasidic Jews in Brooklyn and does Scripture study with Jehovah's Witnesses. He discovers ancient biblical wisdom of startling relevance. And he wrestles with seemingly archaic rules that baffle the twenty-first-century brain.Jacobs's extraordinary undertaking yields unexpected epiphanies and challenges.

Do we need another Lincoln biography? In Team of Rivals, esteemed historian Doris Kearns Goodwin proves that we do. Though she can't help but cover some familiar territory, her perspective is focused enough to offer fresh insights into Lincoln's leadership style and his deep understanding of human behavior and motivation. Goodwin makes the case for Lincoln's political genius by examining his relationships with three men he selected for his cabinet, all of whom were opponents for the Republican nomination in 1860: William H. Seward, Salmon P. Chase, and Edward Bates. These men, all accomplished, nationally known, and presidential, originally disdained Lincoln for his backwoods upbringing and lack of experience, and were shocked and humiliated at losing to this relatively obscure Illinois lawyer. Yet Lincoln not only convinced them to join his administration--Seward as secretary of state, Chase as secretary of the treasury, and Bates as attorney general--he ultimately gained their admiration and respect as well. How he soothed egos, turned rivals into allies, and dealt with many challenges to his leadership, all for the sake of the greater good, is largely what Goodwin's fine book is about. Had he not possessed the wisdom and confidence to select and work with the best people, she argues, he could not have led the nation through one of its darkest periods. Ten years in the making, this engaging work reveals why ""Lincoln's road to success was longer, more tortuous, and far less likely"" than the other men, and why, when opportunity beckoned, Lincoln was ""the best prepared to answer the call."" This multiple biography further provides valuable background and insights into the contributions and talents of Seward, Chase, and Bates. Lincoln may have been ""the indispensable ingredient of the Civil War,"" but these three men were invaluable to Lincoln and they played key roles in keeping the nation intact. --Shawn Carkonen Team of Rivals doesn't just tell the story of Abraham Lincoln. It is a multiple biography of the entire team of personal and political competitors that he put together to lead the country through its greatest crisis. Here, Doris Kearns Goodwin profiles five of the key players in her book, four of whom contended for the 1860 Republican presidential nomination and all of whom later worked together in Lincoln's cabinet.1. Edwin M. StantonStanton treated Lincoln with utter contempt at their initial acquaintance when the two men were involved in a celebrated law case in the summer of 1855. Unimaginable as it might seem after Stanton's demeaning behavior, Lincoln offered him ""the most powerful civilian post within his gift""--the post of secretary of war--at their next encounter six years later. On his first day in office as Simon Cameron's replacement, the energetic, hardworking Stanton instituted ""an entirely new regime"" in the War Department. After nearly a year of disappointment with Cameron, Lincoln had found in Stanton the leader the War Department desperately needed. Lincoln's choice of Stanton revealed his singular ability to transcend personal vendetta, humiliation, or bitterness. As for Stanton, despite his initial contempt for the man he once described as a ""long armed Ape,"" he not only accepted the offer but came to respect and love Lincoln more than any person outside of his immediate family. He was beside himself with grief for weeks after the president's death.2. Salmon P. ChaseChase, an Ohioan, had been both senator and governor, had played a central role in the formation of the national Republican Party, and had shown an unflagging commitment to the cause of the black man. No individual felt he deserved the presidency as a natural result of his past contributions more than Chase himself, but he refused to engage in the practical methods by which nominations are won. He had virtually no campaign and he failed to conciliate his many enemies in Ohio itself. As a result, he alone among the candidates came to the convention without the united support of his own state. Chase never ceased to underestimate Lincoln, nor to resent the fact that he had lost the presidency to a man he considered his inferior. His frustration with his position as secretary of the treasury was alleviated only by his his dogged hope that he, rather than Lincoln, would be the Republican nominee in 1864, and he steadfastly worked to that end. The president put up with Chase's machinations and haughty yet fundamentally insecure nature because he recognized his superlative accomplishments at treasury. Eventually, however, Chase threatened to split the Republican Party by continuing to fill key positions with partisans who supported his presidential hopes. When Lincoln stepped in, Chase tendered his resignation as he had three times before, but this time Lincoln stunned Chase by calling his bluff and accepting the offer.3. Abraham Lincoln When Lincoln won the Republican presidential nomination in 1860 he seemed to have come from nowhere--a backwoods lawyer who had served one undistinguished term in the House of Representatives and lost two consecutive contests for the U.S. Senate. Contemporaries attributed his surprising nomination to chance, to his moderate position on slavery, and to the fact that he hailed from the battleground state of Illinois. But Lincoln's triumph, particularly when viewed against the efforts of his rivals, owed much to a remarkable, unsuspected political acuity and an emotional strength forged in the crucible of hardship and defeat. That Lincoln, after winning the presidency, made the unprecedented decision to incorporate his eminent rivals into his political family, the cabinet, was evidence of an uncanny self-confidence and an indication of what would prove to others a most unexpected greatness.4. William H. Seward A celebrated senator from New York for more than a decade and governor of his state for two terms before going to Washington, Seward was certain he was going to receive his party's nomination for president in 1860. The weekend before the convention in Chicago opened he had already composed a first draft of the valedictory speech he expected to make to the Senate, assuming that he would resign his position as soon as the decision in Chicago was made. His mortification at not having received the nomination never fully abated, and when he was offered his cabinet post as secretary of state he intended to have a major role in choosing the remaining cabinet members, conferring upon himself a position in the new government more commanding than that of Lincoln himself. He quickly realized the futility of his plan to relegate the president to a figurehead role. Though the feisty New Yorker would continue to debate numerous issues with Lincoln in the years ahead, exactly as Lincoln had hoped and needed him to do, Seward would become his closest friend, advisor, and ally in the administration. More than any other cabinet member Seward appreciated Lincoln's peerless skill in balancing factions both within his administration and in the country at large.5. Edward Bates A widely respected elder statesman, a delegate to the convention that framed the Missouri Constitution, and a former Missouri congressman whose opinions on national matters were still widely sought, Bates's ambitions for political success were gradually displaced by love for his wife and large family, and he withdrew from public life in the late 1840s. For the next 20 years he was asked repeatedly to run or once again accept high government posts but he consistently declined. However in early 1860, with letters and newspaper editorials advocating his candidacy crowding in upon him, he decided to try for the highest office in the land. After losing to Lincoln he vowed, in his diary, to decline a cabinet position if one were to be offered, but with the country ""in trouble and danger"" he felt it was his duty to accept when Lincoln asked him to be attorney general. Though Bates initially viewed Lincoln as a well-meaning but incompetent administrator, he eventually concluded that the president was an unmatched leader, ""very near being a 'perfect man.'""

abraham lincoln have been analyzed and dissected in countless books do we need another lincoln biography in team of rivals esteemed historian doris kearns goodwin proves that we do though she can t help but cover some familiar territory her perspective is focused enough to offer fresh insights into lincoln s leadership style and his deep understanding of human behavior and motivation goodwin makes the case for lincoln s political genius by examining his relationships with three men he selected for his cabinet all of whom were opponents for the republican nomination in william h seward salmon p chase and edward bates these men all accomplished nationally known and presidential originally disdained lincoln for his backwoods upbringing and lack of experience and were shocked and humiliated at losing to this relatively obscure illinois lawyer yet lincoln not only convinced them to join his administration seward as secretary of state chase as secretary of the treasury and bates as attorney general he ultimately gained their admiration and respect as well how he soothed egos turned rivals into allies and dealt with many challenges to his leadership all for the sake of the greater good is largely what goodwin s fine book is about had he not possessed the wisdom and confidence to select and work with the best people she argues he could not have led the nation through one of its darkest periods ten years in the making this engaging work reveals why lincoln s road to success was longer more tortuous and far less likely than the other men and why when opportunity beckoned lincoln was the best prepared to answer the call this multiple biography further provides valuable background and insights into the contributions and talents of seward chase and bates lincoln may have been the indispensable ingredient of the civil war but these three men were invaluable to lincoln and they played key roles in keeping the nation intact shawn carkonen team of rivals doesn t just tell the story of abraham lincoln it is a multiple biography of the entire team of personal and political competitors that he put together to lead the country through its greatest crisis here doris kearns goodwin profiles five of the key players in her book four of whom contended for the republican presidential nomination and all of whom later worked together in lincoln s cabinet edwin m stantonstanton treated lincoln with utter contempt at their initial acquaintance when the two men were involved in a celebrated law case in the summer of unimaginable as it might seem after stanton s demeaning behavior lincoln offered him the most powerful civilian post within his gift the post of secretary of war at their next encounter six years later on his first day in office as simon cameron s replacement the energetic hardworking stanton instituted an entirely new regime in the war department after nearly a year of disappointment with cameron lincoln had found in stanton the leader the war department desperately needed lincoln s choice of stanton revealed his singular ability to transcend personal vendetta humiliation or bitterness as for stanton despite his initial contempt for the man he once described as a long armed ape he not only accepted the offer but came to respect and love lincoln more than any person outside of his immediate family he was beside himself with grief for weeks after the president s death salmon p chasechase an ohioan had been both senator and governor had played a central role in the formation of the national republican party and had shown an unflagging commitment to the cause of the black man no individual felt he deserved the presidency as a natural result of his past contributions more than chase himself but he refused to engage in the practical methods by which nominations are won he had virtually no campaign and he failed to conciliate his many enemies in ohio itself as a result he alone among the candidates came to the convention without the united support of his own state chase never ceased to underestimate lincoln nor to resent the fact that he had lost the presidency to a man he considered his inferior his frustration with his position as secretary of the treasury was alleviated only by his his dogged hope that he rather than lincoln would be the republican nominee in and he steadfastly worked to that end the president put up with chase s machinations and haughty yet fundamentally insecure nature because he recognized his superlative accomplishments at treasury eventually however chase threatened to split the republican party by continuing to fill key positions with partisans who supported his presidential hopes when lincoln stepped in chase tendered his resignation as he had three times before but this time lincoln stunned chase by calling his bluff and accepting the offer abraham lincoln when lincoln won the republican presidential nomination in he seemed to have come from nowhere a backwoods lawyer who had served one undistinguished term in the house of representatives and lost two consecutive contests for the u s senate contemporaries attributed his surprising nomination to chance to his moderate position on slavery and to the fact that he hailed from the battleground state of illinois but lincoln s triumph particularly when viewed against the efforts of his rivals owed much to a remarkable unsuspected political acuity and an emotional strength forged in the crucible of hardship and defeat that lincoln after winning the presidency made the unprecedented decision to incorporate his eminent rivals into his political family the cabinet was evidence of an uncanny self confidence and an indication of what would prove to others a most unexpected greatness william h seward a celebrated senator from new york for more than a decade and governor of his state for two terms before going to washington seward was certain he was going to receive his party s nomination for president in the weekend before the convention in chicago opened he had already composed a first draft of the valedictory speech he expected to make to the senate assuming that he would resign his position as soon as the decision in chicago was made his mortification at not having received the nomination never fully abated and when he was offered his cabinet post as secretary of state he

John Adams,57.43,4,http://books.toscrape.com/catalogue/john-adams_472/index.html,"In this powerful, epic biography, David McCullough unfolds the adventurous life-journey of John Adams, the brilliant, fiercely independent, often irascible, always honest Yankee patriot -- ""the colossus of independence,"" as Thomas Jefferson called him -- who spared nothing in his zeal for the American Revolution; who rose to become the second President of the United States In this powerful, epic biography, David McCullough unfolds the adventurous life-journey of John Adams, the brilliant, fiercely independent, often irascible, always honest Yankee patriot -- ""the colossus of independence,"" as Thomas Jefferson called him -- who spared nothing in his zeal for the American Revolution; who rose to become the second President of the United States and saved the country from blundering into an unnecessary war; who was learned beyond all but a few and regarded by some as ""out of his senses""; and whose marriage to the wise and valiant Abigail Adams is one of the moving love stories in American history. Like his masterly, Pulitzer Prize-winning biography Truman, David McCullough's John Adams has the sweep and vitality of a great novel. It is both a riveting portrait of an abundantly human man and a vivid evocation of his time, much of it drawn from an outstanding collection of Adams family letters and diaries. In particular, the more than one thousand surviving letters between John and Abigail Adams, nearly half of which have never been published, provide extraordinary access to their private lives and make it possible to know John Adams as no other major American of his founding era. As he has with stunning effect in his previous books, McCullough tells the story from within -- from the point of view of the amazing eighteenth century and of those who, caught up in events, had no sure way of knowing how things would turn out. George Washington, Benjamin Franklin, John Jay, the British spy Edward Bancroft, Madame Lafayette and Jefferson's Paris ""interest"" Maria Cosway, Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, the scandalmonger James Callender, Sally Hemings, John Marshall, Talleyrand, and Aaron Burr all figure in this panoramic chronicle, as does, importantly, John Quincy Adams, the adored son whom Adams would live to see become President. Crucial to the story, as it was to history, is the relationship between Adams and Jefferson, born opposites -- one a Massachusetts farmer's son, the other a Virginia aristocrat and slaveholder, one short and stout, the other tall and spare. Adams embraced conflict; Jefferson avoided it. Adams had great humor; Jefferson, very little. But they were alike in their devotion to their country. At first they were ardent co-revolutionaries, then fellow diplomats and close friends. With the advent of the two political parties, they became archrivals, even enemies, in the intense struggle for the presidency in 1800, perhaps the most vicious election in history. Then, amazingly, they became friends again, and ultimately, incredibly, they died on the same day -- their day of days -- July 4, in the year 1826. Much about John Adams's life will come as a surprise to many readers. His courageous voyage on the frigate Boston in the winter of 1778 and his later trek over the Pyrenees are exploits that few would have dared and that few readers will ever forget. It is a life encompassing a huge arc -- Adams lived longer than any president. The story ranges from the Boston Massacre to Philadelphia in 1776 to the Versailles of Louis XVI, from Spain to Amsterdam, from the Court of St. James's, where Adams was the first American to stand before King George III as a representative of the new nation, to the raw, half-finished Capital by the Potomac, where Adams was the first President to occupy the White House. This is history on a grand scale -- a book about politics and war and social issues, but also about human nature, love, religious faith, virtue, ambition, friendship and betrayal, and the far-reaching consequences of noble ideas. Above all, John Adams is an enthralling, often surprising story of one of the most important and fascinating Americans who ever lived. ...more",in this powerful epic biography david mccullough unfolds the adventurous life journey of john adams the brilliant fiercely independent often irascible always honest yankee patriot the colossus of independence as thomas jefferson called him who spared nothing in his zeal for the american revolution who rose to become the second president of the united states in this powerful epic biography david mccullough unfolds the adventurous life journey of john adams the brilliant fiercely independent often irascible always honest yankee patriot the colossus of independence as thomas jefferson called him who spared nothing in his zeal for the american revolution who rose to become the second president of the united states and saved the country from blundering into an unnecessary war who was learned beyond all but a few and regarded by some as out of his senses and whose marriage to the wise and valiant abigail adams is one of the moving love stories in american history like his masterly pulitzer prize winning biography truman david mccullough s john adams has the sweep and vitality of a great novel it is both a riveting portrait of an abundantly human man and a vivid evocation of his time much of it drawn from an outstanding collection of adams family letters and diaries in particular the more than one thousand surviving letters between john and abigail adams nearly half of which have never been published provide extraordinary access to their private lives and make it possible to know john adams as no other major american of his founding era as he has with stunning effect in his previous books mccullough tells the story from within from the point of view of the amazing eighteenth century and of those who caught up in events had no sure way of knowing how things would turn out george washington benjamin franklin john jay the british spy edward bancroft madame lafayette and jefferson s paris interest maria cosway alexander hamilton james madison the scandalmonger james callender sally hemings john marshall talleyrand and aaron burr all figure in this panoramic chronicle as does importantly john quincy adams the adored son whom adams would live to see become president crucial to the story as it was to history is the relationship between adams and jefferson born opposites one a massachusetts farmer s son the other a virginia aristocrat and slaveholder one short and stout the other tall and spare adams embraced conflict jefferson avoided it adams had great humor jefferson very little but they were alike in their devotion to their country at first they were ardent co revolutionaries then fellow diplomats and close friends with the advent of the two political parties they became archrivals even enemies in the intense struggle for the presidency in perhaps the most vicious election in history then amazingly they became friends again and ultimately incredibly they died on the same day their day of days july in the year much about john adams s life will come as a surprise to many readers his courageous voyage on the frigate boston in the winter of and his later trek over the pyrenees are exploits that few would have dared and that few readers will ever forget it is a life encompassing a huge arc adams lived longer than any president the story ranges from the boston massacre to philadelphia in to the versailles of louis xvi from spain to amsterdam from the court of st james s where adams was the first american to stand before king george iii as a representative of the new nation to the raw half finished capital by the potomac where adams was the first president to occupy the white house this is history on a grand scale a book about politics and war and social issues but also about human nature love religious faith virtue ambition friendship and betrayal and the far reaching consequences of noble ideas above all john adams is an enthralling often surprising story of one of the most important and fascinating americans who ever lived more,David McCullough

An ambitious urban entrepreneur who rose up the social ladder, from leather-aproned shopkeeper to dining with kings, he seems made of flesh rather than of marble. In bestselling author Walter Isaacson's vivid and witty full-scale biography, we discover why Franklin seems to turn to us from history's stage with eyes Benjamin Franklin is the Founding Father who winks at us. An ambitious urban entrepreneur who rose up the social ladder, from leather-aproned shopkeeper to dining with kings, he seems made of flesh rather than of marble. In bestselling author Walter Isaacson's vivid and witty full-scale biography, we discover why Franklin seems to turn to us from history's stage with eyes that twinkle from behind his new-fangled spectacles. By bringing Franklin to life, Isaacson shows how he helped to define both his own time and ours. He was, during his 84-year life, America's best scientist, inventor, diplomat, writer, and business strategist, and he was also one of its most practical -- though not most profound -- political thinkers. He proved by flying a kite that lightning was electricity, and he invented a rod to tame it. He sought practical ways to make stoves less smoky and commonwealths less corrupt. He organized neighborhood constabularies and international alliances, local lending libraries and national legislatures. He combined two types of lenses to create bifocals and two concepts of representation to foster the nation's federal compromise. He was the only man who shaped all the founding documents of America: the Albany Plan of Union, the Declaration of Independence, the treaty of alliance with France, the peace treaty with England, and the Constitution. And he helped invent America's unique style of homespun humor, democratic values, and philosophical pragmatism. But the most interesting thing that Franklin invented, and continually reinvented, was himself. America's first great publicist, he was, in his life and in his writings, consciously trying to create a new American archetype. In the process, he carefully crafted his own persona, portrayed it in public, and polished it for posterity. Through it all, he trusted the hearts and minds of his fellow ""leather-aprons"" more than he did those of any inbred elite. He saw middle-class values as a source of social strength, not as something to be derided. His guiding principle was a ""dislike of everything that tended to debase the spirit of the common people."" Few of his fellow founders felt this comfort with democracy so fully, and none so intuitively. In this colorful and intimate narrative, Isaacson provides the full sweep of Franklin's amazing life, from his days as a runaway printer to his triumphs as a statesman, scientist, and Founding Father. He chronicles Franklin's tumultuous relationship with his illegitimate son and grandson, his practical marriage, and his flirtations with the ladies of Paris. He also shows how Franklin helped to create the American character and why he has a particular resonance in the twenty-first century. ...more",benjamin franklin is the founding father who winks at us an ambitious urban entrepreneur who rose up the social ladder from leather aproned shopkeeper to dining with kings he seems made of flesh rather than of marble in bestselling author walter isaacson s vivid and witty full scale biography we discover why franklin seems to turn to us from history s stage with eyes benjamin franklin is the founding father who winks at us an ambitious urban entrepreneur who rose up the social ladder from leather aproned shopkeeper to dining with kings he seems made of flesh rather than of marble in bestselling author walter isaacson s vivid and witty full scale biography we discover why franklin seems to turn to us from history s stage with eyes that twinkle from behind his new fangled spectacles by bringing franklin to life isaacson shows how he helped to define both his own time and ours he was during his year life america s best scientist inventor diplomat writer and business strategist and he was also one of its most practical though not most profound political thinkers he proved by flying a kite that lightning was electricity and he invented a rod to tame it he sought practical ways to make stoves less smoky and commonwealths less corrupt he organized neighborhood constabularies and international alliances local lending libraries and national legislatures he combined two types of lenses to create bifocals and two concepts of representation to foster the nation s federal compromise he was the only man who shaped all the founding documents of america the albany plan of union the declaration of independence the treaty of alliance with france the peace treaty with england and the constitution and he helped invent america s unique style of homespun humor democratic values and philosophical pragmatism but the most interesting thing that franklin invented and continually reinvented was himself america s first great publicist he was in his life and in his writings consciously trying to create a new american archetype in the process he carefully crafted his own persona portrayed it in public and polished it for posterity through it all he trusted the hearts and minds of his fellow leather aprons more than he did those of any inbred elite he saw middle class values as a source of social strength not as something to be derided his guiding principle was a dislike of everything that tended to debase the spirit of the common people few of his fellow founders felt this comfort with democracy so fully and none so intuitively in this colorful and intimate narrative isaacson provides the full sweep of franklin s amazing life from his days as a runaway printer to his triumphs as a statesman scientist and founding father he chronicles franklin s tumultuous relationship with his illegitimate son and grandson his practical marriage and his flirtations with the ladies of paris he also shows how franklin helped to create the american character and why he has a particular resonance in the twenty first century more,Walter Isaacson

It's the book your grandmother and mother probably learned to cook from, the book you gave your sister when she got married. This, the first revision in more than twenty years, is better than ever. Here's why: Every chapter has been rethought with an emphasis on freshness, convenience, and health.All the recipes have been reconceived and tested with an eye to modern taste, and the cooking knowledge imparted with each subject enriched to the point where everyone from a beginning to an experienced cook will feel completely supported.The new Joy continues the vision of American cooking that began with the first edition of Joy. It is still the book you can turn to for perfect Beef Wellington and Baked Macaroni and Cheese. It's also the book where you can now find Turkey on the Grill, Spicy Peanut Sesame Noodles, and vegetarian meals.The new Joy provides more thorough descriptions of ingredients, from the familiar to the most exotic. For instance, almost all the varieties of apples grown domestically are described-- the months they become available, how they taste, what they are best used for, and how long they keep. But for the first time Joy features a complete section on fresh and dried chili peppers: how to roast and grill them, how to store them, and how long they keep-- with illustrations of each pepper.An all-new ""RULES"" section in many chapters gives essential cooking basics at a glance: washing and storing salad greens, selecting a pasta and a matching sauce, determining when a piece of fish is cooked through, stuffing a chicken, and making a perfect souffle.New chapters reflect changing American tastes and lifestyles:Separate new chapters on grains, beans, and pasta include recipes for grits, polenta, pilafs, risottos, vegetarian chills, bean casseroles, and make-ahead lasagnes.New baking and dessert chapters promise to enhance Joy of Cooking's reputation as a bible for bakers. Quick and yeast bread recipes range from focaccia, pizza, and sourdoughs to muffins and coffee cakes. Separate chapters cover custards and puddings, pies and tarts, cookies, cakes, cobblers, and other American fruit desserts revived for this edition. Recipes include one-bowl cakes, gingerbread, angel and sponge cakes, meringues, pound cakes, fruitcakes, 6 different kinds of cheesecake-- there's even an illustrated wedding cake recipe, which takes you through all the stages from building a stand, making and decorating the cake, to transporting it to the reception without a hitch.Little Dishes showcases foods from around the world: hummus, baba ghanoush, bruschetta, tacos, empanadas, and fried wontons.AII new drawings of techniques, ingredients, and equipment, integrated throughout an elegant new design, and over 300 more pages round out the new Joy.Among this book's other unique features: microwave instructions for preparing beans, grains, and vegetables; dozens of new recipes for people who are lactose intolerant and allergic to gluten; expanded ingredients chart now features calories, essential vitamins, and levels of fats and cholesterol.

Born into minor German nobility, she transformed herself into an empress by sheer determination. Possessing a brilliant, curious mind, she devoured the works of Enlightenment philosophers, and reaching the throne, tried using their principles to rule the vast, backward empire. She knew or corresponded with notable figures of her time: Voltaire, Diderot, Frederick the Great, Maria Theresa of Austria, Marie Antoinette & John Paul Jones. Wanting to be the “benevolent despot” Montesquieu idealized, she contended with the deeply ingrained realities of Russian life, including serfdom. She persevered, and for 34 years the government, foreign policy, cultural development and welfare of the Russian people were in her hands. She dealt with domestic rebellion, wars & the tides of political change and violence inspired by the French Revolution. Her reputation depended on the perspective of the speaker. She was praised by Voltaire as like the classical philosophers. She was condemned by enemies, mostly foreign, as “the Messalina of the north.” Her family, friends, ministers, generals, lovers and enemies are vividly described. These included her ambitious, scheming mother; her weak, bullying husband, Peter (who left her sexually untouched for nine years after their marriage); her unhappy son & heir, Paul; her beloved grandchildren; and her favorites — the young men from whom she sought companionship and the recapture of youth as well as sex. Here, too, is Gregory Potemkin, her most significant lover & possible husband, with whom she shared a correspondence of love & separation, followed by 17 years of unparalleled mutual achievement. All the qualities that Massie brought to Nicholas & Alexandra and Peter the Great are present: historical accuracy, deep understanding, felicity of style, mastery of detail, ability to shatter myth & a genius for finding and expressing a human drama. ...more",pulitzer prize winner massie offers the tale of a princess who went to russia at and became one of the most powerful women in history born into minor german nobility she transformed herself into an empress by sheer determination possessing a brilliant curious mind she devoured the works of enlightenment philosophers and reaching the throne tried using their princ pulitzer prize winner massie offers the tale of a princess who went to russia at and became one of the most powerful women in history born into minor german nobility she transformed herself into an empress by sheer determination possessing a brilliant curious mind she devoured the works of enlightenment philosophers and reaching the throne tried using their principles to rule the vast backward empire she knew or corresponded with notable figures of her time voltaire diderot frederick the great maria theresa of austria marie antoinette john paul jones wanting to be the benevolent despot montesquieu idealized she contended with the deeply ingrained realities of russian life including serfdom she persevered and for years the government foreign policy cultural development and welfare of the russian people were in her hands she dealt with domestic rebellion wars the tides of political change and violence inspired by the french revolution her reputation depended on the perspective of the speaker she was praised by voltaire as like the classical philosophers she was condemned by enemies mostly foreign as the messalina of the north her family friends ministers generals lovers and enemies are vividly described these included her ambitious scheming mother her weak bullying husband peter who left her sexually untouched for nine years after their marriage her unhappy son heir paul her beloved grandchildren and her favorites the young men from whom she sought companionship and the recapture of youth as well as sex here too is gregory potemkin her most significant lover possible husband with whom she shared a correspondence of love separation followed by years of unparalleled mutual achievement all the qualities that massie brought to nicholas alexandra and peter the great are present historical accuracy deep understanding felicity of style mastery of detail ability to shatter myth a genius for finding and expressing a human drama more,Unknown

Without meaningful regulation, capitalist economies will concentrate wealth in an ever smaller number of hands. Armed with this knowledge, democratic societies face a defining challenge: fending off a new aristocracy. For years, Piketty has wrestled with this problem in his monthly newspaper column, which pierces the surface of current events to reveal the economic forces underneath. Why Save the Bankers? brings together selected columns, now translated and annotated, from the period book-ended by the September 2008 collapse of Lehman Brothers and the Paris attacks of November 2015. In between, writing from the vantage point of his native France, Piketty brilliantly decodes the European sovereign debt crisis, an urgent struggle against the tyranny of markets that bears lessons for the world at large. And along the way, he weighs in on oligarchy in the United States, wonders whether debts actually need to be paid back, and discovers surprising lessons about inequality by examining the career of Steve Jobs.

William Geroux has unearthed a fascinating tale of one small coastal town caught in the thick of the fight, and he tells it with a sharp reporter’s eye and a real feel for the heroic men who went down to the sea in ships.” —Evan Thomas, author of Being Nixon and Sea of ThunderMathews County, Virginia, is a remote outpost on the Chesapeake Bay with little to offer except unspoiled scenery—but it sent one of the largest concentrations of sea captains and U.S. merchant mariners of any community in America to fight in World War II. The Mathews Men tells that heroic story through the experiences of one extraordinary family whose seven sons (and their neighbors), U.S. merchant mariners all, suddenly found themselves squarely in the cross-hairs of the U-boats bearing down on the coastal United States in 1942.             From the late 1930s to 1945, virtually all the fuel, food and munitions that sustained the Allies in Europe traveled not via the Navy but in merchant ships. After Pearl Harbor, those unprotected ships instantly became the U-boats’ prime targets. And they were easy targets—the Navy lacked the inclination or resources to defend them until the beginning of 1943. Hitler was determined that his U-boats should sink every American ship they could find, sometimes within sight of tourist beaches, and to kill as many mariners as possible, in order to frighten their shipmates into staying ashore.             As the war progressed, men from Mathews sailed the North and South Atlantic, the Caribbean, the Gulf of Mexico, the Mediterranean, the Indian Ocean, and even the icy Barents Sea in the Arctic Circle, where they braved the dreaded Murmansk Run. Through their experiences we have eyewitnesses to every danger zone, in every kind of ship. Some died horrific deaths. Others fought to survive torpedo explosions, flaming oil slicks, storms, shark attacks, mine blasts, and harrowing lifeboat odysseys—only to ship out again on the next boat as soon as they'd returned to safety.            The Mathews Men shows us the war far beyond traditional battlefields—often the U.S. merchant mariners’ life-and-death struggles took place just off the U.S. coast—but also takes us to the landing beaches at D-Day and to the Pacific. “When final victory is ours,” General Dwight D. Eisenhower had predicted, “there is no organization that will share its credit more deservedly than the Merchant Marine.” Here, finally, is the heroic story of those merchant seamen, recast as the human story of the men from Mathews. ...more",one of the last unheralded heroic stories of world war ii the u boat assault off the american coast against the men of the u s merchant marine who were supplying the european war and one community s monumental contribution to that effortpraise for the mathews men the german u boat war against american merchant men was deadly and dramatic in world war ii the u s mercha one of the last unheralded heroic stories of world war ii the u boat assault off the american coast against the men of the u s merchant marine who were supplying the european war and one community s monumental contribution to that effortpraise for the mathews men the german u boat war against american merchant men was deadly and dramatic in world war ii the u s merchant marine had twice the fatality rate of the u s navy william geroux has unearthed a fascinating tale of one small coastal town caught in the thick of the fight and he tells it with a sharp reporter s eye and a real feel for the heroic men who went down to the sea in ships evan thomas author of being nixon and sea of thundermathews county virginia is a remote outpost on the chesapeake bay with little to offer except unspoiled scenery but it sent one of the largest concentrations of sea captains and u s merchant mariners of any community in america to fight in world war ii the mathews men tells that heroic story through the experiences of one extraordinary family whose seven sons and their neighbors u s merchant mariners all suddenly found themselves squarely in the cross hairs of the u boats bearing down on the coastal united states in from the late s to virtually all the fuel food and munitions that sustained the allies in europe traveled not via the navy but in merchant ships after pearl harbor those unprotected ships instantly became the u boats prime targets and they were easy targets the navy lacked the inclination or resources to defend them until the beginning of hitler was determined that his u boats should sink every american ship they could find sometimes within sight of tourist beaches and to kill as many mariners as possible in order to frighten their shipmates into staying ashore as the war progressed men from mathews sailed the north and south atlantic the caribbean the gulf of mexico the mediterranean the indian ocean and even the icy barents sea in the arctic circle where they braved the dreaded murmansk run through their experiences we have eyewitnesses to every danger zone in every kind of ship some died horrific deaths others fought to survive torpedo explosions flaming oil slicks storms shark attacks mine blasts and harrowing lifeboat odysseys only to ship out again on the next boat as soon as they d returned to safety the mathews men shows us the war far beyond traditional battlefields often the u s merchant mariners life and death struggles took place just off the u s coast but also takes us to the landing beaches at d day and to the pacific when final victory is ours general dwight d eisenhower had predicted there is no organization that will share its credit more deservedly than the merchant marine here finally is the heroic story of those merchant seamen recast as the human story of the men from mathews more,Unknown

Why are we here? Why is there something rather than nothing? What is the nature of reality? Why are the laws of nature so finely tuned as to allow for the existence of beings like ours THE FIRST MAJOR WORK IN NEARLY A DECADE BY ONE OF THE WORLD’S GREAT THINKERS—A MARVELOUSLY CONCISE BOOK WITH NEW ANSWERS TO THE ULTIMATE QUESTIONS OF LIFE When and how did the universe begin? Why are we here? Why is there something rather than nothing? What is the nature of reality? Why are the laws of nature so finely tuned as to allow for the existence of beings like ourselves? And, finally, is the apparent “grand design” of our universe evidence of a benevolent creator who set things in motion—or does science offer another explanation? The most fundamental questions about the origins of the universe and of life itself, once the province of philosophy, now occupy the territory where scientists, philosophers, and theologians meet—if only to disagree. In their new book, Stephen Hawking and Leonard Mlodinow present the most recent scientific thinking about the mysteries of the universe, in nontechnical language marked by both brilliance and simplicity. In The Grand Design they explain that according to quantum theory, the cosmos does not have just a single existence or history, but rather that every possible history of the universe exists simultaneously. When applied to the universe as a whole, this idea calls into question the very notion of cause and effect. But the “top-down” approach to cosmology that Hawking and Mlodinow describe would say that the fact that the past takes no definite form means that we create history by observing it, rather than that history creates us. The authors further explain that we ourselves are the product of quantum fluctuations in the very early universe, and show how quantum theory predicts the “multiverse”—the idea that ours is just one of many universes that appeared spontaneously out of nothing, each with different laws of nature.Along the way Hawking and Mlodinow question the conventional concept of reality, posing a “model-dependent” theory of reality as the best we can hope to find. And they conclude with a riveting assessment of M-theory, an explanation of the laws governing us and our universe that is currently the only viable candidate for a complete “theory of everything.” If confirmed, they write, it will be the unified theory that Einstein was looking for, and the ultimate triumph of human reason.A succinct, startling, and lavishly illustrated guide to discoveries that are altering our understanding and threatening some of our most cherished belief systems, The Grand Design is a book that will inform—and provoke—like no other. ...more",the first major work in nearly a decade by one of the world s great thinkers a marvelously concise book with new answers to the ultimate questions of lifewhen and how did the universe begin why are we here why is there something rather than nothing what is the nature of reality why are the laws of nature so finely tuned as to allow for the existence of beings like ours the first major work in nearly a decade by one of the world s great thinkers a marvelously concise book with new answers to the ultimate questions of life when and how did the universe begin why are we here why is there something rather than nothing what is the nature of reality why are the laws of nature so finely tuned as to allow for the existence of beings like ourselves and finally is the apparent grand design of our universe evidence of a benevolent creator who set things in motion or does science offer another explanation the most fundamental questions about the origins of the universe and of life itself once the province of philosophy now occupy the territory where scientists philosophers and theologians meet if only to disagree in their new book stephen hawking and leonard mlodinow present the most recent scientific thinking about the mysteries of the universe in nontechnical language marked by both brilliance and simplicity in the grand design they explain that according to quantum theory the cosmos does not have just a single existence or history but rather that every possible history of the universe exists simultaneously when applied to the universe as a whole this idea calls into question the very notion of cause and effect but the top down approach to cosmology that hawking and mlodinow describe would say that the fact that the past takes no definite form means that we create history by observing it rather than that history creates us the authors further explain that we ourselves are the product of quantum fluctuations in the very early universe and show how quantum theory predicts the multiverse the idea that ours is just one of many universes that appeared spontaneously out of nothing each with different laws of nature along the way hawking and mlodinow question the conventional concept of reality posing a model dependent theory of reality as the best we can hope to find and they conclude with a riveting assessment of m theory an explanation of the laws governing us and our universe that is currently the only viable candidate for a complete theory of everything if confirmed they write it will be the unified theory that einstein was looking for and the ultimate triumph of human reason a succinct startling and lavishly illustrated guide to discoveries that are altering our understanding and threatening some of our most cherished belief systems the grand design is a book that will inform and provoke like no other more,Stephen Hawking

Arleen is a single mo New York Times BestsellerFrom Harvard sociologist and MacArthur ""Genius"" Matthew Desmond, a landmark work of scholarship and reportage that will forever change the way we look at poverty in America In this brilliant, heartbreaking book, Matthew Desmond takes us into the poorest neighborhoods of Milwaukee to tell the story of eight families on the edge. Arleen is a single mother trying to raise her two sons on the $20 a month she has left after paying for their rundown apartment. Scott is a gentle nurse consumed by a heroin addiction. Lamar, a man with no legs and a neighborhood full of boys to look after, tries to work his way out of debt. Vanetta participates in a botched stickup after her hours are cut. All are spending almost everything they have on rent, and all have fallen behind. The fates of these families are in the hands of two landlords: Sherrena Tarver, a former schoolteacher turned inner-city entrepreneur, and Tobin Charney, who runs one of the worst trailer parks in Milwaukee. They loathe some of their tenants and are fond of others, but as Sherrena puts it, “Love don’t pay the bills.” She moves to evict Arleen and her boys a few days before Christmas. Even in the most desolate areas of American cities, evictions used to be rare. But today, most poor renting families are spending more than half of their income on housing, and eviction has become ordinary, especially for single mothers. In vivid, intimate prose, Desmond provides a ground-level view of one of the most urgent issues facing America today. As we see families forced  into shelters, squalid apartments, or more dangerous neighborhoods, we bear witness to the human cost of America’s vast inequality—and to people’s determination and intelligence in the face of hardship. Based on years of embedded fieldwork and painstakingly gathered data, this masterful book transforms our understanding of extreme poverty and economic exploitation while providing fresh ideas for solving a devastating, uniquely American problem. Its unforgettable scenes of hope and loss remind us of the centrality of home, without which nothing else is possible. ...more",new york times bestsellerfrom harvard sociologist and macarthur genius matthew desmond a landmark work of scholarship and reportage that will forever change the way we look at poverty in americain this brilliant heartbreaking book matthew desmond takes us into the poorest neighborhoods of milwaukee to tell the story of eight families on the edge arleen is a single mo new york times bestsellerfrom harvard sociologist and macarthur genius matthew desmond a landmark work of scholarship and reportage that will forever change the way we look at poverty in america in this brilliant heartbreaking book matthew desmond takes us into the poorest neighborhoods of milwaukee to tell the story of eight families on the edge arleen is a single mother trying to raise her two sons on the a month she has left after paying for their rundown apartment scott is a gentle nurse consumed by a heroin addiction lamar a man with no legs and a neighborhood full of boys to look after tries to work his way out of debt vanetta participates in a botched stickup after her hours are cut all are spending almost everything they have on rent and all have fallen behind the fates of these families are in the hands of two landlords sherrena tarver a former schoolteacher turned inner city entrepreneur and tobin charney who runs one of the worst trailer parks in milwaukee they loathe some of their tenants and are fond of others but as sherrena puts it love don t pay the bills she moves to evict arleen and her boys a few days before christmas even in the most desolate areas of american cities evictions used to be rare but today most poor renting families are spending more than half of their income on housing and eviction has become ordinary especially for single mothers in vivid intimate prose desmond provides a ground level view of one of the most urgent issues facing america today as we see families forced into shelters squalid apartments or more dangerous neighborhoods we bear witness to the human cost of america s vast inequality and to people s determination and intelligence in the face of hardship based on years of embedded fieldwork and painstakingly gathered data this masterful book transforms our understanding of extreme poverty and economic exploitation while providing fresh ideas for solving a devastating uniquely american problem its unforgettable scenes of hope and loss remind us of the centrality of home without which nothing else is possible more,Unknown

America's War for the Greater Middle East: A Military History,51.22,2,http://books.toscrape.com/catalogue/americas-war-for-the-greater-middle-east-a-military-history_361/index.html,"Retired army colonel and New York Times bestselling author Andrew J.

Bacevich provides a searing reassessment of U.S. military policy in the Middle East over the past four decades. From the end of World War II until 1980, virtually no American soldiers were killed in action while serving in the Greater Middle East. Since 1990, virtually no American soldiers have been killed in action anywhere else. What caused this shift? Andrew J. Bacevich, one of the country’s most respected voices on foreign affairs, offers an incisive critical history of this ongoing military enterprise—now more than thirty years old and with no end in sight. During the 1980s, Bacevich argues, a great transition occurred. As the Cold War wound down, the United States initiated a new conflict—a War for the Greater Middle East—that continues to the present day. The long twilight struggle with the Soviet Union had involved only occasional and sporadic fighting. But as this new war unfolded, hostilities became persistent. From the Balkans and East Africa to the Persian Gulf and Central Asia, U.S. forces embarked upon a seemingly endless series of campaigns across the Islamic world. Few achieved anything remotely like conclusive success. Instead, actions undertaken with expectations of promoting peace and stability produced just the opposite. As a consequence, phrases like “permanent war” and “open-ended war” have become part of everyday discourse. Connecting the dots in a way no other historian has done before, Bacevich weaves a compelling narrative out of episodes as varied as the Beirut bombing of 1983, the Mogadishu firefight of 1993, the invasion of Iraq in 2003, and the rise of ISIS in the present decade. Understanding what America’s costly military exertions have wrought requires seeing these seemingly discrete events as parts of a single war. It also requires identifying the errors of judgment made by political leaders in both parties and by senior military officers who share responsibility for what has become a monumental march to folly. This Bacevich unflinchingly does. A twenty-year army veteran who served in Vietnam, Andrew J. Bacevich brings the full weight of his expertise to this vitally important subject. America’s War for the Greater Middle East is a bracing after-action report from the front lines of history. It will fundamentally change the way we view America’s engagement in the world’s most volatile region.Advance praise for America’s War for the Greater Middle East“In one arresting book after another, Bacevich has relentlessly laid bare the failings of American foreign policy since the Cold War. This one is his sad crowning achievement: the story of our long and growing military entanglement in the region of the most tragic, bitter, and intractable of conflicts.”—Richard K. Betts, director, Saltzman Institute of War and Peace Studies, Columbia University “An unparalleled historical tour de force certain to affect the formation of future U.S. foreign policy . . . Every citizen aspiring to high office needs not only to read but to study and learn from this important book. This is one of the most serious and essential books I have read in more than half a century of public service.”—Lieutenant General Paul K. Van Riper, U.S. Marine Corps (Ret.) “Bacevich asks and answers a provocative, inconvenient question: In a multigenerational war in the Middle East, ‘Why has the world’s mightiest military achieved so little?’ ”—Graham Allison, director, Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs, and Douglas Dillon Professor of Government at Harvard’s John F.

Leaning on each other, Nichole and Leanne discover that their inner strength and capacity for love are greater than they ever imagined. When Nichole discovers that her husband, Jake, has been unfaithful, the illusion of her perfect life is indelibly shattered. While juggling her young son, a new job, and volunteer work, Nichole meets Rocco, who is the opposite of Jake in nearly every way. Though blunt-spoken and rough around the edges, Rocco proves to be a dedicated father and thoughtful friend. But just as their relationship begins to blossom, Jake wagers everything on winning Nichole back—including their son Owen’s happiness. Somehow, Nichole must find the courage to defy her fears and follow her heart, with far-reaching consequences for them all.

Two great leaders—Lord Eddard Stark and Robert Baratheon—who held sway over an age of enforced peace are dead...victims of royal treachery. Now, from the ancient citadel of Dragonstone to the forbidding shores of Winterfell, chaos reigns, as pretenders to the Iron Throne of the Seven Kingdoms prepare to stake their claims through tempest, turmoil, and war. As a prophecy of doom cuts across the sky—a comet the color of blood and flame—six factions struggle for control of a divided land. Eddard's son Robb has declared himself King in the North. In the south, Joffrey, the heir apparent, rules in name only, victim of the scheming courtiers who teem over King's Landing. Robert's two brothers each seek their own dominion, while a disfavored house turns once more to conquest.

And the spoils of victory may just go to the men and women possessed of the coldest steel...and the coldest hearts. For when rulers clash, all of the land feels the tremors.

Inspired by Einstein, Coltrane had put physics and geometry at the core of his music. Physicist and jazz musician Stephon Alexander returns the favor, using jazz to answer physics’ most vexing questions about the past and future of the universe.Following the great minds that first drew the links between music and physics—a list including Pythagoras, Kepler, Newton, Einstein, and Rakim—The Jazz of Physics revisits the ancient realm where music, physics, and the cosmos were one. This cosmological journey accompanies Alexander’s own tale of struggling to reconcile his passion for music and physics, from taking music lessons as a boy in the Bronx to studying theoretical physics at Imperial College, London’s inner sanctum of string theory. Playing the saxophone and improvising with equations, Alexander uncovered the connection between the fundamental waves that make up sound and the fundamental waves that make up everything else. As he reveals, the ancient poetic idea of the “music of the spheres,” taken seriously, clarifies confounding issues in physics.Whether you are more familiar with Brian Greene or Brian Eno, John Coltrane or John Wheeler, the Five Percent Nation or why the universe is less than five percent visible, there is a new discovery on every page.

America Americans have always loved guns. This special bond was forged during the American Revolution and sanctified by the Second Amendment. It is because of this exceptional relationship that American civilians are more heavily armed than the citizens of any other nation.Or so we’re told.In The Gunning of America, historian Pamela Haag overturns this conventional wisdom. American gun culture, she argues, developed not because the gun was exceptional, but precisely because it was not: guns proliferated in America because throughout most of the nation’s history, they were perceived as an unexceptional commodity, no different than buttons or typewriters.Focusing on the history of the Winchester Repeating Arms Company, one of the most iconic arms manufacturers in America, Haag challenges many basic assumptions of how and when America became a gun culture. Under the leadership of Oliver Winchester and his heirs, the company used aggressive, sometimes ingenious sales and marketing techniques to create new markets for their product. Guns have never “sold themselves”; rather, through advertising and innovative distribution campaigns, the gun industry did. Through the meticulous examination of gun industry archives, Haag challenges the myth of a primal bond between Americans and their firearms. Over the course of its 150 year history, the Winchester Repeating Arms Company sold over 8 million guns. But Oliver Winchester—a shirtmaker in his previous career—had no apparent qualms about a life spent arming America. His daughter-in-law Sarah Winchester was a different story. Legend holds that Sarah was haunted by what she considered a vast blood fortune, and became convinced that the ghosts of rifle victims were haunting her. She channeled much of her inheritance, and her conflicted conscience, into a monstrous estate now known as the Winchester Mystery House, where she sought refuge from this ever-expanding army of phantoms.In this provocative and deeply-researched work of narrative history, Haag fundamentally revises the history of arms in America, and in so doing explodes the clichés that have created and sustained our lethal gun culture. ...more",americans have always loved guns this special bond was forged during the american revolution and sanctified by the second amendment it is because of this exceptional relationship that american civilians are more heavily armed than the citizens of any other nation or so we re told in the gunning of america historian pamela haag overturns this conventional wisdom america americans have always loved guns this special bond was forged during the american revolution and sanctified by the second amendment it is because of this exceptional relationship that american civilians are more heavily armed than the citizens of any other nation or so we re told in the gunning of america historian pamela haag overturns this conventional wisdom american gun culture she argues developed not because the gun was exceptional but precisely because it was not guns proliferated in america because throughout most of the nation s history they were perceived as an unexceptional commodity no different than buttons or typewriters focusing on the history of the winchester repeating arms company one of the most iconic arms manufacturers in america haag challenges many basic assumptions of how and when america became a gun culture under the leadership of oliver winchester and his heirs the company used aggressive sometimes ingenious sales and marketing techniques to create new markets for their product guns have never sold themselves rather through advertising and innovative distribution campaigns the gun industry did through the meticulous examination of gun industry archives haag challenges the myth of a primal bond between americans and their firearms over the course of its year history the winchester repeating arms company sold over million guns but oliver winchester a shirtmaker in his previous career had no apparent qualms about a life spent arming america his daughter in law sarah winchester was a different story legend holds that sarah was haunted by what she considered a vast blood fortune and became convinced that the ghosts of rifle victims were haunting her she channeled much of her inheritance and her conflicted conscience into a monstrous estate now known as the winchester mystery house where she sought refuge from this ever expanding army of phantoms in this provocative and deeply researched work of narrative history haag fundamentally revises the history of arms in america and in so doing explodes the clich s that have created and sustained our lethal gun culture more,Pamela Haag

He creates art for human beings. Humanity is the goal.”—Bronislaw HubermanAt fourteen, Bronislaw Huberman played the Brahms Violin Concerto in Vienna— winning high praise from the composer himself, who was there. Instantly famous, Huberman began touring all over the world and received invitations to play for royalty across Europe. But after witnessing the tragedy of World War I, he committed his phenomenal talent and celebrity to aid humanity.After studying at the Sorbonne in Paris, Huberman joined the ranks of Sigmund Freud and Albert Einstein in calling for peace through the Pan European Movement. But when hope for their noble vision was destroyed by the rise of Nazism, Huberman began a crusade that would become his greatest legacy—the creation, in 1936, of the Palestine Symphony, which twelve years later became the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra.In creating this world-level orchestra, Huberman miraculously arranged for the very best Jewish musicians and their families to emigrate from Nazi-threatened territories. His tireless campaigning for the project—including a marathon fundraising concert tour across America—ultimately saved nearly a thousand Jews from the approaching Holocaust. Inviting the great Arturo Toscanini to conduct the orchestra’s first concert, Huberman’s clarion call of art over cruelty was heard around the world. His story contains estraordinary adventures, riches and royalty, politicians and broken promises, losses and triumphs. Against near impossible obstacles, Huberman refused to give up on his dream to create a unique and life-saving orchestra of exiles which was one of the great cultural achievements of the 20th century.Includes Photographs ...more",the compelling biography of the violinist who founded the palestine symphony orchestra and saved hundreds of people from hitler as seen in josh aronson s documentary orchestra of exiles the true artist does not create art as an end in itself he creates art for human beings humanity is the goal bronislaw hubermanat fourteen bronislaw huberman played the brahms violin the compelling biography of the violinist who founded the palestine symphony orchestra and saved hundreds of people from hitler as seen in josh aronson s documentary orchestra of exiles the true artist does not create art as an end in itself he creates art for human beings humanity is the goal bronislaw hubermanat fourteen bronislaw huberman played the brahms violin concerto in vienna winning high praise from the composer himself who was there instantly famous huberman began touring all over the world and received invitations to play for royalty across europe but after witnessing the tragedy of world war i he committed his phenomenal talent and celebrity to aid humanity after studying at the sorbonne in paris huberman joined the ranks of sigmund freud and albert einstein in calling for peace through the pan european movement but when hope for their noble vision was destroyed by the rise of nazism huberman began a crusade that would become his greatest legacy the creation in of the palestine symphony which twelve years later became the israel philharmonic orchestra in creating this world level orchestra huberman miraculously arranged for the very best jewish musicians and their families to emigrate from nazi threatened territories his tireless campaigning for the project including a marathon fundraising concert tour across america ultimately saved nearly a thousand jews from the approaching holocaust inviting the great arturo toscanini to conduct the orchestra s first concert huberman s clarion call of art over cruelty was heard around the world his story contains estraordinary adventures riches and royalty politicians and broken promises losses and triumphs against near impossible obstacles huberman refused to give up on his dream to create a unique and life saving orchestra of exiles which was one of the great cultural achievements of the th century includes photographs more,Unknown

She still runs into people who remember the poster. Unfortunately, in the post-crash economy, cult memorabilia doesn't pay the rent, and right now she's a journalist in need of a job. The last person she wants to work for is Hubertus Bigend, twisted genius of global marketing; but there's no way to tell an entity like Bigend that you want nothing more to do with him. That simply brings you more firmly to his attention. Milgrim is clean, drug-free for the first time in a decade. It took eight months in a clinic in Basel. Fifteen complete changes of his blood.

Max Brooks, driven by the urgency of preserving the acid-etched first-hand experiences of the survivors from those apocalyptic years, traveled across the United States of America and throughout the world, from decimated cities that once teemed with upwards of thirty million souls to the most remote and inhospitable areas of the planet. He recorded the testimony of men, women, and sometimes children who came face-to-face with the living, or at least the undead, hell of that dreadful time. ""World War Z"" is the result. Never before have we had access to a document that so powerfully conveys the depth of fear and horror, and also the ineradicable spirit of resistance, that gripped human society through the plague years. Ranging from the now infamous village of New Dachang in the United Federation of China, where the epidemiological trail began with the twelve-year-old Patient Zero, to the unnamed northern forests where untold numbers sought a terrible and temporary refuge in the cold, to the United States of Southern Africa, where the Redeker Plan provided hope for humanity at an unspeakable price, to the west-of-the-Rockies redoubt where the North American tide finally started to turn, this invaluable chronicle reflects the full scope and duration of the Zombie War. Most of all, the book captures with haunting immediacy the human dimension of this epochal event. Facing the often raw and vivid nature of these personal accounts requires a degree of courage on the part of the reader, but the effort is invaluable because, as Mr. Brooks says in his introduction, ""By excluding the human factor, aren't we risking the kind of personal detachment from history that may, heaven forbid, lead us one day to repeat it?

Over 200 years ago the Founders broke away from the tyranny of the British Empire to build a nation based on the principles of freedom, equal rights, and opportunity for all men. But life in the United States today is vastly different from anything the original Founders could have imagined in the late 1700s. The notion of an African-American president of the United States, or a woman such as Condoleezza Rice or Hillary Clinton as Secretary of State, would have been unimaginable to the men who wrote the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution, or who ratified the Constitution or the Bill of Rights.   In a fascinating work of history told through a series of in depth profiles, prize-winning journalist, bestselling author, and Fox political analyst Juan Williams takes readers into the life and work of a new generation of American Founders, who honor the original Founders’ vision, even as they have quietly led revolutions in American politics, immigration, economics, sexual behavior, and reshaped the landscape of the nation. Among the modern-day pioneers Williams writes about in this compelling new book are the passionate conservative President Reagan; the determined fighters for equal rights, Thurgood Marshall and Martin Luther King, Jr.; the profound imprint of Rev. Billy Graham’s evangelism on national politics; the focus on global human rights advocated by First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt; the leaders of the gay community who refused to back down during the Stonewall Riots and brought gay life into America’s public square; the re-imagined role of women in contemporary life as shaped by Betty Friedan.   Williams reveals how each of these modern-day founders has extended the Founding Fathers original vision and changed fundamental aspects of our country, from immigration, to the role of American labor in the economy, from modern police strategies, to the importance of religion in our political discourse. America in the 21st Century remains rooted in the Great American experiment in democracy that began in 1776. For all the changes our economy and our cultural and demographic make-up, there remains a straight line from the first Founders’ original vision, to the principles and ideals of today’s courageous modern day pioneers. ...more",what would the founding fathers think about america today over years ago the founders broke away from the tyranny of the british empire to build a nation based on the principles of freedom equal rights and opportunity for all men but life in the united states today is vastly different from anything the original founders could have imagined in the late s the no what would the founding fathers think about america today over years ago the founders broke away from the tyranny of the british empire to build a nation based on the principles of freedom equal rights and opportunity for all men but life in the united states today is vastly different from anything the original founders could have imagined in the late s the notion of an african american president of the united states or a woman such as condoleezza rice or hillary clinton as secretary of state would have been unimaginable to the men who wrote the declaration of independence and the constitution or who ratified the constitution or the bill of rights in a fascinating work of history told through a series of in depth profiles prize winning journalist bestselling author and fox political analyst juan williams takes readers into the life and work of a new generation of american founders who honor the original founders vision even as they have quietly led revolutions in american politics immigration economics sexual behavior and reshaped the landscape of the nation among the modern day pioneers williams writes about in this compelling new book are the passionate conservative president reagan the determined fighters for equal rights thurgood marshall and martin luther king jr the profound imprint of rev billy graham s evangelism on national politics the focus on global human rights advocated by first lady eleanor roosevelt the leaders of the gay community who refused to back down during the stonewall riots and brought gay life into america s public square the re imagined role of women in contemporary life as shaped by betty friedan williams reveals how each of these modern day founders has extended the founding fathers original vision and changed fundamental aspects of our country from immigration to the role of american labor in the economy from modern police strategies to the importance of religion in our political discourse america in the st century remains rooted in the great american experiment in democracy that began in for all the changes our economy and our cultural and demographic make up there remains a straight line from the first founders original vision to the principles and ideals of today s courageous modern day pioneers more,Unknown

Now, Anna turns her thoughts to that larger question. We are eating differently: your daughter is a vegan, or you are but your in-laws don’t think it’s dinner without meat, or you’re hosting Thanksgiving for a mixed group… In this timely and useful new book, Anna offers her solutions for reuniting our divided tables.“My idea is simple,” says Anna. “Start with the food everyone eats, design a meal or a dish around that, then expand and elaborate with just the right amounts of the right cheeses, meats, or fish for your omnivores. Everyone feels welcome, and we eat the same meal—but in variations.”Anna shows us how to cook for today’s table, with over 150 recipes for all tastes, and menus for every occasion. For a casual evening with friends, Farro with Lentils and Lavender served with Ratatouille from the Charcoal Grill makes a beautiful vegan supper—and also pairs wonderfully with garlic-and-herb rubbed lamb chops for the omnivores. Anna’s crowd-pleasing Easy Fish Soup begins as a robust vegetable soup, with seafood added five minutes before serving—an ideal two-way dish. A vegetarian Lemon Risotto with Sautéed Fresh Fava Beans is perfect on its own, and can easily take on tender shrimp. For dessert, have vegan Pumpkin Gingerbread and add vanilla ice cream, or serve a delectable Dark Chocolate Almond Bark studded with ginger and dried cherries.Anna’s festive “Thanksgiving for Everyone” menu centers on a sumptuous Polenta Torta with Roasted Squash and onion marmalade, surrounded by an array of seasonal vegetables—all pairing equally well with roast turkey for the traditionalists. “Taco Night at Home” allows everyone to design their perfect meal, mixing and matching from a spread of Spicy Black Beans, Poblano Peppers with Portobello Mushrooms, Carnitas, and Guajillo Chile Salsa. Anna’s exuberant Mediterranean mezze menu is a relaxed summer party, featuring vegan Roasted Eggplant and Poblano Chile Spread with flatbread, Tabbouleh with Chickpeas and Preserved Lemon, Charred Zucchini with Lemon and Mint, and Baked Lamb Kibbeh Wedges for the omnivores.With dishes inspired by the vibrant produce of farmers’ markets, Anna shares her love of cooking and of hospitality.

But in the months that followed, it grew into something more for Ken Ilgunas. It became an irresistible adventure—an opportunity not only to draw attention to global warming but also to explore his personal limits. So in September 2012, he strapped on his backpack, stuck out his thumb on the interstate just north of Denver, and hitchhiked 1,500 miles to the Alberta tar sands. Once there, he turned around and began his 1,700-mile trek to the XL’s endpoint on the Gulf Coast of Texas, a journey he would complete entirely on foot, walking almost exclusively across private property.Both a travel memoir and a reflection on climate change, Trespassing Across America is filled with colorful characters, harrowing physical trials, and strange encounters with the weather, terrain, and animals of America’s plains. A tribute to the Great Plains and the people who live there, Ilgunas’s memoir grapples with difficult questions about our place in the world: What is our personal responsibility as stewards of the land? As members of a rapidly warming planet? As mere individuals up against something as powerful as the fossil fuel industry? Ultimately, Trespassing Across America is a call to embrace the belief that a life lived not half wild is a life only half lived. ...more",told with sincerity humor and wit trespassing across americais both a fascinating account of one man s remarkable journey along the keystone xl pipeline and a meditation on climate change the beauty of the natural world and the extremes to which we can push ourselves both physically and mentally it started as a far fetched idea to hike the entire length of the propose told with sincerity humor and wit trespassing across america is both a fascinating account of one man s remarkable journey along the keystone xl pipeline and a meditation on climate change the beauty of the natural world and the extremes to which we can push ourselves both physically and mentally it started as a far fetched idea to hike the entire length of the proposed route of the keystone xl pipeline but in the months that followed it grew into something more for ken ilgunas it became an irresistible adventure an opportunity not only to draw attention to global warming but also to explore his personal limits so in september he strapped on his backpack stuck out his thumb on the interstate just north of denver and hitchhiked miles to the alberta tar sands once there he turned around and began his mile trek to the xl s endpoint on the gulf coast of texas a journey he would complete entirely on foot walking almost exclusively across private property both a travel memoir and a reflection on climate change trespassing across america is filled with colorful characters harrowing physical trials and strange encounters with the weather terrain and animals of america s plains a tribute to the great plains and the people who live there ilgunas s memoir grapples with difficult questions about our place in the world what is our personal responsibility as stewards of the land as members of a rapidly warming planet as mere individuals up against something as powerful as the fossil fuel industry ultimately trespassing across america is a call to embrace the belief that a life lived not half wild is a life only half lived more,Unknown

She isn’t a chef or a restaurant owner—she’s never even waitressed. Cooking in her tiny Manhattan kitchen was, at least at first, for special occasions—and, too often, an unnecessarily daunting venture. Deb found herself overwhelmed by the number of recipes available to her. Have you ever searched for the perfect birthday cake on Google? You’ll get more than three million results. How do you choose? Where do you start? What if you pick a recipe that’s downright bad?So Deb founded her award-winning blog, smittenkitchen.com, on the premise that cooking should be a pleasure, and that the results of your labor can—and should be—delicious...every time. Deb is a firm believer that there are no bad cooks, just bad recipes. She has dedicated herself to finding the best of the best and adapting them for the everyday cook—the ones with little time to spare, little money to burn on unpronounceable ingredients, and little help in the kitchen. And now, with the same warmth, candor, and can-do spirit her blog is known for, Deb presents her first cookbook—more than 100 new recipes, plus a few favorites from her site, all gorgeously illustrated with hundreds of Deb’s beautiful color photographs.The Smitten Kitchen Cookbook is all about approachable, uncompromised home cooking: stepped-up comfort foods, stewy dishes for windy winter afternoons, an apple cake that will answer all questions: “What should my new signature dessert be?” “What is always welcome at a potluck?” “What did Deb consume almost single-handedly a week after having a baby?” These are the recipes you bookmark and use so often they become your own; recipes you slip to a friend who wants to impress her new in-laws; and recipes with simple ingredients that yield amazing results in a minimum amount of time. Deb tells you how to host a brunch and still sleep in—plus what to make for it!—and the essential items you need for your own kitchen. From salads and slaws that make perfect side dishes (or a full meal) to savory tarts and pizzas; from Mushroom Bourguignon to Pancetta, White Bean and Swiss Chard Pot Pies; from Buttered Popcorn Cookies to Chocolate Hazelnut Layer Cake, Deb knows just the thing for a Tuesday night, or your most special occasion. ...more",the long awaited cookbook by deb perelman of smitten kitchen home cook mom photographer and celebrated food blogger deb perelman loves to cook it s as simple as that she isn t a chef or a restaurant owner she s never even waitressed cooking in her tiny manhattan kitchen was at least at first for special occasions and too often an unnecessarily daunting venture d the long awaited cookbook by deb perelman of smitten kitchen home cook mom photographer and celebrated food blogger deb perelman loves to cook it s as simple as that she isn t a chef or a restaurant owner she s never even waitressed cooking in her tiny manhattan kitchen was at least at first for special occasions and too often an unnecessarily daunting venture deb found herself overwhelmed by the number of recipes available to her have you ever searched for the perfect birthday cake on google you ll get more than three million results how do you choose where do you start what if you pick a recipe that s downright bad so deb founded her award winning blog smittenkitchen com on the premise that cooking should be a pleasure and that the results of your labor can and should be delicious every time deb is a firm believer that there are no bad cooks just bad recipes she has dedicated herself to finding the best of the best and adapting them for the everyday cook the ones with little time to spare little money to burn on unpronounceable ingredients and little help in the kitchen and now with the same warmth candor and can do spirit her blog is known for deb presents her first cookbook more than new recipes plus a few favorites from her site all gorgeously illustrated with hundreds of deb s beautiful color photographs the smitten kitchen cookbook is all about approachable uncompromised home cooking stepped up comfort foods stewy dishes for windy winter afternoons an apple cake that will answer all questions what should my new signature dessert be what is always welcome at a potluck what did deb consume almost single handedly a week after having a baby these are the recipes you bookmark and use so often they become your own recipes you slip to a friend who wants to impress her new in laws and recipes with simple ingredients that yield amazing results in a minimum amount of time deb tells you how to host a brunch and still sleep in plus what to make for it and the essential items you need for your own kitchen from salads and slaws that make perfect side dishes or a full meal to savory tarts and pizzas from mushroom bourguignon to pancetta white bean and swiss chard pot pies from buttered popcorn cookies to chocolate hazelnut layer cake deb knows just the thing for a tuesday night or your most special occasion more,Deb Perelman

While paintings of Picasso and Jackson Pollock sell for a hundred million dollars or more, and lines from T. S. Eliot are quoted on the yearbook pages of alienated teenagers across the land, twentieth-century classical music still sends ripples of unease through audiences. At the same time, its influence can be felt everywhere. Atonal chords crop up in jazz. Avant-garde sounds populate the soundtracks of Hollywood thrillers. Minimalism has had a huge effect on rock, pop, and dance music from the Velvet Underground onward.The Rest Is Noise shows why twentieth-century composers felt compelled to create a famously bewildering variety of sounds, from the purest beauty to the purest noise. It tells of a remarkable array of maverick personalities who resisted the cult of the classical past, struggled against the indifference of a wide public, and defied the will of dictators. Whether they have charmed audiences with sweet sounds or battered them with dissonance, composers have always been exuberantly of the present, defying the stereotype of classical music as a dying art. The narrative goes from Vienna before the First World War to Paris in the twenties, from Hitler's Germany and Stalin's Russia to downtown New York in the sixties and seventies.

Followi A deeply evocative story of ambition and betrayal, The Paris Wife captures a remarkable period of time and a love affair between two unforgettable people: Ernest Hemingway and his wife Hadley.Chicago, 1920: Hadley Richardson is a quiet twenty-eight-year-old who has all but given up on love and happiness—until she meets Ernest Hemingway and her life changes forever. Following a whirlwind courtship and wedding, the pair set sail for Paris, where they become the golden couple in a lively and volatile group—the fabled “Lost Generation”—that includes Gertrude Stein, Ezra Pound, and F. Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald. Though deeply in love, the Hemingways are ill-prepared for the hard-drinking and fast-living life of Jazz Age Paris, which hardly values traditional notions of family and monogamy. Surrounded by beautiful women and competing egos, Ernest struggles to find the voice that will earn him a place in history, pouring all the richness and intensity of his life with Hadley and their circle of friends into the novel that will become The Sun Also Rises. Hadley, meanwhile, strives to hold on to her sense of self as the demands of life with Ernest grow costly and her roles as wife, friend, and muse become more challenging. Despite their extraordinary bond, they eventually find themselves facing the ultimate crisis of their marriage—a deception that will lead to the unraveling of everything they’ve fought so hard for.

In this conversation with Vatican r NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • In his first book published as Pope, and in conjunction with the Extraordinary Jubilee of Mercy, Pope Francis here invites all humanity to an intimate and personal dialogue on the subject closest to his heart—mercy—which has long been the cornerstone of his faith and is now the central teaching of his papacy. In this conversation with Vatican reporter Andrea Tornielli, Francis explains—through memories from his youth and moving anecdotes from his experiences as a pastor—why “mercy is the first attribute of God.” God “does not want anyone to be lost. His mercy is infinitely greater than our sins,” he writes. As well, the Church cannot close the door on anyone, Francis asserts—on the contrary, its duty is to go out into the world to find its way into the consciousness of people so that they can assume responsibility for, and move away from, the bad things they have done. The first Jesuit and the first South American to be elected Bishop of Rome, Pope Francis has traveled around the world spreading God’s message of mercy to the largest crowds in papal history. Clear and profound, The Name of God Is Mercy resonates with this desire to reach all those who are looking for meaning in life, a road to peace and reconciliation, and the healing of physical and spiritual wounds. It is being published in more than eighty countries around the world.“The name of God is mercy. There are no situations we cannot get out of, we are not condemned to sink into quicksand.”—Pope FrancisPraise for The Name of God Is Mercy “Francis speaks succinctly—and with refreshing forthrightness. . . . He emphasizes moral sincerity over dogma, an understanding of the complexities of the world and individual experience over rigid doctrine. . . . The pope has an easy conversational style that moves effortlessly between folksy sayings and erudite allusions, between common-sense logic and impassioned philosophical insights.”—Michiko Kakutani, The New York Times“What makes his book most moving is the way in which this man, without disrespecting his own privacy or offering false bromides of modesty, opens the sacred space of his conscience to explain how he came to center his ministry, and now his papacy, around mercy.”—James Carroll, The New Yorker“As he has done throughout his papacy, Pope Francis shows in this book a compelling way to present God’s love anew to a skeptical world without denying the ancient teachings of faith. But now he is challenging the entire Church to trek a new way forward.”—Time “Francis enjoys sharing personal stories of God’s grace and mercy in the lives of parishioners from his native Argentina, people he has known and who have recognized themselves as sinners.”—The Washington Post“Powerful . . . Francis’s book signals a plea for a change of attitude on the part of the faithful and their pastors. . . . Bishops and priests will talk and quarrel over the text for months, even years to come.

But many of those failures are preventable.  The Lean Startup is a new approach being adopted across the globe, changing the way companies are built and new products are launched. Eric Ries defines a startup as an organization dedicated to creating something new under conditions of extreme uncertainty. This is just as true for one person in a garage or a group of seasoned professionals in a Fortune 500 boardroom. What they have in common is a mission to penetrate that fog of uncertainty to discover a successful path to a sustainable business. The Lean Startup approach fosters companies that are both more capital efficient and that leverage human creativity more effectively.  Inspired by lessons from lean manufacturing, it relies on “validated learning,” rapid scientific experimentation, as well as a number of counter-intuitive practices that shorten product development cycles, measure actual progress without resorting to vanity metrics, and learn what customers really want. It enables a company to shift directions with agility, altering plans inch by inch, minute by minute. Rather than wasting time creating elaborate business plans, The Lean Startup offers entrepreneurs - in companies of all sizes - a way to test their vision continuously, to adapt and adjust before it’s too late.

Now, in The Last Painting of Sara de Vos, he deftly bridges the historical and the contemporary, tracking a collision course between a rare landscape by a female Dutch painter of the golden age, an inheritor of the work in 1950s Manhattan, and a celebrated art historian who painted a forgery of it in her youth.In 1631, Sara de Vos is admitted as a master painter to the Guild of St. Luke's in Holland, the first woman to be so recognized.

Although they are often labeled ""quiet,"" it is to introverts that we owe many of the great contributions to society--from van Gogh’s At least one-third of the people we know are introverts. They are the ones who prefer listening to speaking, reading to partying; who innovate and create but dislike self-promotion; who favor working on their own over brainstorming in teams. Although they are often labeled ""quiet,"" it is to introverts that we owe many of the great contributions to society--from van Gogh’s sunflowers to the invention of the personal computer.Passionately argued, impressively researched, and filled with indelible stories of real people, Quiet shows how dramatically we undervalue introverts, and how much we lose in doing so. Taking the reader on a journey from Dale Carnegie’s birthplace to Harvard Business School, from a Tony Robbins seminar to an evangelical megachurch, Susan Cain charts the rise of the Extrovert Ideal in the twentieth century and explores its far-reaching effects. She talks to Asian-American students who feel alienated from the brash, backslapping atmosphere of American schools. She questions the dominant values of American business culture, where forced collaboration can stand in the way of innovation, and where the leadership potential of introverts is often overlooked. And she draws on cutting-edge research in psychology and neuroscience to reveal the surprising differences between extroverts and introverts.Perhaps most inspiring, she introduces us to successful introverts--from a witty, high-octane public speaker who recharges in solitude after his talks, to a record-breaking salesman who quietly taps into the power of questions. Finally, she offers invaluable advice on everything from how to better negotiate differences in introvert-extrovert relationships to how to empower an introverted child to when it makes sense to be a ""pretend extrovert.""This extraordinary book has the power to permanently change how we see introverts and, equally important, how introverts see themselves. ...more",at least one third of the people we know are introverts they are the ones who prefer listening to speaking reading to partying who innovate and create but dislike self promotion who favor working on their own over brainstorming in teams although they are often labeled quiet it is to introverts that we owe many of the great contributions to society from van gogh s at least one third of the people we know are introverts they are the ones who prefer listening to speaking reading to partying who innovate and create but dislike self promotion who favor working on their own over brainstorming in teams although they are often labeled quiet it is to introverts that we owe many of the great contributions to society from van gogh s sunflowers to the invention of the personal computer passionately argued impressively researched and filled with indelible stories of real people quiet shows how dramatically we undervalue introverts and how much we lose in doing so taking the reader on a journey from dale carnegie s birthplace to harvard business school from a tony robbins seminar to an evangelical megachurch susan cain charts the rise of the extrovert ideal in the twentieth century and explores its far reaching effects she talks to asian american students who feel alienated from the brash backslapping atmosphere of american schools she questions the dominant values of american business culture where forced collaboration can stand in the way of innovation and where the leadership potential of introverts is often overlooked and she draws on cutting edge research in psychology and neuroscience to reveal the surprising differences between extroverts and introverts perhaps most inspiring she introduces us to successful introverts from a witty high octane public speaker who recharges in solitude after his talks to a record breaking salesman who quietly taps into the power of questions finally she offers invaluable advice on everything from how to better negotiate differences in introvert extrovert relationships to how to empower an introverted child to when it makes sense to be a pretend extrovert this extraordinary book has the power to permanently change how we see introverts and equally important how introverts see themselves more,Book Junkie

Women hold just 20 percent of seats in parliaments globally, and in the world of big business, a meagre eighteen of the Fortune 500 CEOs are women.In Lean In, Sheryl Sandberg – Facebook COO and one of Fortune magazine's Most Powerful Women in Business – draws on her own experience of working in some of the world's most successful businesses and looks at what women can do to help themselves, and make the small changes in their life that can effect change on a more universal scale. ...more",sheryl sandberg s lean in is a massive cultural phenomenon and its title has become an instant catchphrase for empowering women the book soared to the top of bestseller lists internationally igniting global conversations about women and ambition sandberg packed theatres dominated opinion pages appeared on every major television show and on the cover of time magazine sheryl sandberg s lean in is a massive cultural phenomenon and its title has become an instant catchphrase for empowering women the book soared to the top of bestseller lists internationally igniting global conversations about women and ambition sandberg packed theatres dominated opinion pages appeared on every major television show and on the cover of time magazine and sparked ferocious debate about women and leadership ask most women whether they have the right to equality at work and the answer will be a resounding yes but ask the same women whether they d feel confident asking for a raise a promotion or equal pay and some reticence creeps in the statistics although an improvement on previous decades are certainly not in women s favour of heads of state only twenty two are women women hold just percent of seats in parliaments globally and in the world of big business a meagre eighteen of the fortune ceos are women in lean in sheryl sandberg facebook coo and one of fortune magazine s most powerful women in business draws on her own experience of working in some of the world s most successful businesses and looks at what women can do to help themselves and make the small changes in their life that can effect change on a more universal scale more,Worth Books

Dodd becomes America’s first ambassador to Hitler’s Germany in a year that proved to be a turning point in history. A mild-mannered professor from Chicago, Dodd brings along his wife, son, and flamboyant daughter, Martha. At first Martha is entranced by the parties and pomp, and the handsome young men of the Third Reich with their infectious enthusiasm for restoring Germany to a position of world prominence. Enamored of the “New Germany,” she has one affair after another, including with the suprisingly honorable first chief of the Gestapo, Rudolf Diels. But as evidence of Jewish persecution mounts, confirmed by chilling first-person testimony, her father telegraphs his concerns to a largely indifferent State Department back home. Dodd watches with alarm as Jews are attacked, the press is censored, and drafts of frightening new laws begin to circulate. As that first year unfolds and the shadows deepen, the Dodds experience days full of excitement, intrigue, romance—and ultimately, horror, when a climactic spasm of violence and murder reveals Hitler’s true character and ruthless ambition. Suffused with the tense atmosphere of the period, and with unforgettable portraits of the bizarre Göring and the expectedly charming--yet wholly sinister--Goebbels, In the Garden of Beasts lends a stunning, eyewitness perspective on events as they unfold in real time, revealing an era of surprising nuance and complexity.

The passeng #1 New York Times BestsellerFrom the bestselling author and master of narrative nonfiction comes the enthralling story of the sinking of the LusitaniaOn May 1, 1915, with WWI entering its tenth month, a luxury ocean liner as richly appointed as an English country house sailed out of New York, bound for Liverpool, carrying a record number of children and infants. The passengers were surprisingly at ease, even though Germany had declared the seas around Britain to be a war zone. For months, German U-boats had brought terror to the North Atlantic. But the Lusitania was one of the era’s great transatlantic “Greyhounds”—the fastest liner then in service—and her captain, William Thomas Turner, placed tremendous faith in the gentlemanly strictures of warfare that for a century had kept civilian ships safe from attack. Germany, however, was determined to change the rules of the game, and Walther Schwieger, the captain of Unterseeboot-20, was happy to oblige. Meanwhile, an ultra-secret British intelligence unit tracked Schwieger’s U-boat, but told no one. As U-20 and the Lusitania made their way toward Liverpool, an array of forces both grand and achingly small—hubris, a chance fog, a closely guarded secret, and more—all converged to produce one of the great disasters of history. It is a story that many of us think we know but don’t, and Erik Larson tells it thrillingly, switching between hunter and hunted while painting a larger portrait of America at the height of the Progressive Era. Full of glamour and suspense, Dead Wake brings to life a cast of evocative characters, from famed Boston bookseller Charles Lauriat to pioneering female architect Theodate Pope to President Woodrow Wilson, a man lost to grief, dreading the widening war but also captivated by the prospect of new love.  Gripping and important, Dead Wake captures the sheer drama and emotional power of a disaster whose intimate details and true meaning have long been obscured by history. ...more", new york times bestsellerfrom thebestselling author and master of narrative nonfiction comes the enthralling story of the sinking of the lusitaniaon may with wwi entering its tenth month a luxury ocean liner as richly appointed as an english country house sailed out of new york bound for liverpool carrying a record number of children and infants the passeng new york times bestsellerfrom the bestselling author and master of narrative nonfiction comes the enthralling story of the sinking of the lusitaniaon may with wwi entering its tenth month a luxury ocean liner as richly appointed as an english country house sailed out of new york bound for liverpool carrying a record number of children and infants the passengers were surprisingly at ease even though germany had declared the seas around britain to be a war zone for months german u boats had brought terror to the north atlantic but the lusitania was one of the era s great transatlantic greyhounds the fastest liner then in service and her captain william thomas turner placed tremendous faith in the gentlemanly strictures of warfare that for a century had kept civilian ships safe from attack germany however was determined to change the rules of the game and walther schwieger the captain of unterseeboot was happy to oblige meanwhile an ultra secret british intelligence unit tracked schwieger s u boat but told no one as u and the lusitania made their way toward liverpool an array of forces both grand and achingly small hubris a chance fog a closely guarded secret and more all converged to produce one of the great disasters of history it is a story that many of us think we know but don t and erik larson tells it thrillingly switching between hunter and hunted while painting a larger portrait of america at the height of the progressive era full of glamour and suspense dead wake brings to life a cast of evocative characters from famed boston bookseller charles lauriat to pioneering female architect theodate pope to president woodrow wilson a man lost to grief dreading the widening war but also captivated by the prospect of new love gripping and important dead wake captures the sheer drama and emotional power of a disaster whose intimate details and true meaning have long been obscured by history more,Unknown

It is both witness and tribute to the late theory of mind—the so-called structural theory, with its stress on aggression, indeed the death drive, as the pitiless adversary of eros.Civilization and Its Discontents is one of the last of Freud's books, written in the decade before his death and first published in German in 1929. In it he states his views on the broad question of man's place in the world, a place Freud defines in terms of ceaseless conflict between the individual's quest for freedom and society's demand for conformity.Freud's theme is that what works for civilization doesn't necessarily work for man. Man, by nature aggressive and egotistical, seeks self-satisfaction. But culture inhibits his instinctual drives. The result is a pervasive and familiar guilt.Of the various English translations of Freud's major works to appear in his lifetime, only one was authorized by Freud himself: The Standard Edition of the Complete Psychological Works of Sigmund Freud under the general editorship of James Strachey.Freud approved the overall editorial plan, specific renderings of key words and phrases, and the addition of valuable notes, from bibliographical and explanatory.

In search of an answer, Christopher McDougall sets off to find a tribe of the world’s greatest distance runners and learn their secrets, and in the process shows us that everything we thought we knew about running is wrong.Isolated by the most savage terrain in North America, the reclusive Tarahumara Indians of Mexico’s deadly Copper Canyons are custodians of a lost art. For centuries they have practiced techniques that allow them to run hundreds of miles without rest and chase down anything from a deer to an Olympic marathoner while enjoying every mile of it. Their superhuman talent is matched by uncanny health and serenity, leaving the Tarahumara immune to the diseases and strife that plague modern existence. With the help of Caballo Blanco, a mysterious loner who lives among the tribe, the author was able not only to uncover the secrets of the Tarahumara but also to find his own inner ultra-athlete, as he trained for the challenge of a lifetime: a fifty-mile race through the heart of Tarahumara country pitting the tribe against an odd band of Americans, including a star ultramarathoner, a beautiful young surfer, and a barefoot wonder.With a sharp wit and wild exuberance, McDougall takes us from the high-tech science labs at Harvard to the sun-baked valleys and freezing peaks across North America, where ever-growing numbers of ultrarunners are pushing their bodies to the limit, and, finally, to the climactic race in the Copper Canyons. Born to Run is that rare book that will not only engage your mind but inspire your body when you realize that the secret to happiness is right at your feet, and that you, indeed all of us, were born to run. ...more",full of incredible characters amazing athletic achievements cutting edge science and most of all pure inspiration born to run is an epic adventure that began with one simple question why does my foot hurt in search of an answer christopher mcdougall sets off to find a tribe of the world s greatest distance runners and learn their secrets and in the process shows full of incredible characters amazing athletic achievements cutting edge science and most of all pure inspiration born to run is an epic adventure that began with one simple question why does my foot hurt in search of an answer christopher mcdougall sets off to find a tribe of the world s greatest distance runners and learn their secrets and in the process shows us that everything we thought we knew about running is wrong isolated by the most savage terrain in north america the reclusive tarahumara indians of mexico s deadly copper canyons are custodians of a lost art for centuries they have practiced techniques that allow them to run hundreds of miles without rest and chase down anything from a deer to an olympic marathoner while enjoying every mile of it their superhuman talent is matched by uncanny health and serenity leaving the tarahumara immune to the diseases and strife that plague modern existence with the help of caballo blanco a mysterious loner who lives among the tribe the author was able not only to uncover the secrets of the tarahumara but also to find his own inner ultra athlete as he trained for the challenge of a lifetime a fifty mile race through the heart of tarahumara country pitting the tribe against an odd band of americans including a star ultramarathoner a beautiful young surfer and a barefoot wonder with a sharp wit and wild exuberance mcdougall takes us from the high tech science labs at harvard to the sun baked valleys and freezing peaks across north america where ever growing numbers of ultrarunners are pushing their bodies to the limit and finally to the climactic race in the copper canyons born to run is that rare book that will not only engage your mind but inspire your body when you realize that the secret to happiness is right at your feet and that you indeed all of us were born to run more,Christopher McDougall

Why are some peopl In his landmark bestseller The Tipping Point, Malcolm Gladwell redefined how we understand the world around us. Now, in Blink, he revolutionizes the way we understand the world within. Blink is a book about how we think without thinking, about choices that seem to be made in an instant--in the blink of an eye--that actually aren't as simple as they seem. Why are some people brilliant decision makers, while others are consistently inept? Why do some people follow their instincts and win, while others end up stumbling into error? How do our brains really work-in the office, in the classroom, in the kitchen, and in the bedroom? And why are the best decisions often those that are impossible to explain to others?In Blink we meet the psychologist who has learned to predict whether a marriage will last, based on a few minutes of observing a couple; the tennis coach who knows when a player will double-fault before the racket even makes contact with the ball; the antiquities experts who recognize a fake at a glance.

Little did he know that among those released was Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, a man who would go on to become a terrorist mastermind too dangerous even for al-Qaeda and give rise to an Islamist movement bent on dominating the Middle East.     Zarqawi began by directing hotel bombings and assassinations in Jordan from a base in northern Iraq, but it was the American invasion of that country in 2003 that catapulted him to the head of a vast insurgency. By identifying him as the link between Saddam and bin Laden, the CIA inadvertently created a monster. Like-minded radicals saw him as a hero resisting the infidel occupiers and rallied to his cause. Their wave of brutal beheadings and suicide bombings continued for years until Jordanian intelligence provided the Americans with the crucial intelligence needed to eliminate Zarqawi in a 2006 airstrike.     But his movement endured, first called al-Qaeda in Iraq, then renamed Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, or ISIS, seeking refuge in unstable, ungoverned pockets on the Iraq-Syria border. And as the Syrian civil war broke out in 2011, ISIS seized its chance to pursue Zarqawi's dream of a sweeping, ultra-conservative Islamic caliphate.      Drawing on unique access to CIA and Jordanian sources, Joby Warrick weaves together heart-pounding, moment-by-moment operational details with overarching historical perspectives to reveal the long trajectory of today's most dangerous Islamic extremist threat.From the Hardcover edition. ...more",pulitzer prize winning reporter joby warrick reveals how the strain of militant islam now raising its banner across iraq and syria spread from a remote jordanian prison with the unwitting aid of american military intervention when he succeeded his father in king abdullah of jordan released a batch of political prisoners in the hopes of smoothing his transition to pow pulitzer prize winning reporter joby warrick reveals how the strain of militant islam now raising its banner across iraq and syria spread from a remote jordanian prison with the unwitting aid of american military intervention when he succeeded his father in king abdullah of jordan released a batch of political prisoners in the hopes of smoothing his transition to power little did he know that among those released was abu musab al zarqawi a man who would go on to become a terrorist mastermind too dangerous even for al qaeda and give rise to an islamist movement bent on dominating the middle east zarqawi began by directing hotel bombings and assassinations in jordan from a base in northern iraq but it was the american invasion of that country in that catapulted him to the head of a vast insurgency by identifying him as the link between saddam and bin laden the cia inadvertently created a monster like minded radicals saw him as a hero resisting the infidel occupiers and rallied to his cause their wave of brutal beheadings and suicide bombings continued for years until jordanian intelligence provided the americans with the crucial intelligence needed to eliminate zarqawi in a airstrike but his movement endured first called al qaeda in iraq then renamed islamic state of iraq and syria or isis seeking refuge in unstable ungoverned pockets on the iraq syria border and as the syrian civil war broke out in isis seized its chance to pursue zarqawi s dream of a sweeping ultra conservative islamic caliphate drawing on unique access to cia and jordanian sources joby warrick weaves together heart pounding moment by moment operational details with overarching historical perspectives to reveal the long trajectory of today s most dangerous islamic extremist threat from the hardcover edition more,Worth Books

Maybe you think it’s your ability to design tools, your sense of self, or your grasp of past and future—all traits that have helped us define ourselves as the planet’s preeminent species. But in recent decades, these claims have eroded, or even been disproven outright, by a revolution in the study of animal cognition. Take the way octopuses use coconut shells as tools; elephants that classify humans by age, gender, and language; or Ayumu, the young male chimpanzee at Kyoto University whose flash memory puts that of humans to shame. Based on research involving crows, dolphins, parrots, sheep, wasps, bats, whales, and of course chimpanzees and bonobos, Frans de Waal explores both the scope and the depth of animal intelligence. He offers a firsthand account of how science has stood traditional behaviorism on its head by revealing how smart animals really are, and how we’ve underestimated their abilities for too long.People often assume a cognitive ladder, from lower to higher forms, with our own intelligence at the top. But what if it is more like a bush, with cognition taking different forms that are often incomparable to ours? Would you presume yourself dumber than a squirrel because you’re less adept at recalling the locations of hundreds of buried acorns? Or would you judge your perception of your surroundings as more sophisticated than that of a echolocating bat? De Waal reviews the rise and fall of the mechanistic view of animals and opens our minds to the idea that animal minds are far more intricate and complex than we have assumed.

A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius,54.29,5,http://books.toscrape.com/catalogue/a-heartbreaking-work-of-staggering-genius_115/index.html,"Dave Eggers is a terrifically talented writer; don't hold his cleverness against him.

What to make of a book called A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius: Based on a True Story? For starters, there's a good bit of staggering genius before you even get to the true story, including a preface, a list of ""Rules and Suggestions for Enjoyment of This Book,"" and a 20-page acknowledgements section complete with special mail-in offer, flow chart of the book's themes, and a lovely pen-and-ink drawing of a stapler (helpfully labeled ""Here is a drawing of a stapler:""). But on to the true story. At the age of 22, Eggers became both an orphan and a ""single mother"" when his parents died within five months of one another of unrelated cancers. In the ensuing sibling division of labor, Dave is appointed unofficial guardian of his 8-year-old brother, Christopher. The two live together in semi-squalor, decaying food and sports equipment scattered about, while Eggers worries obsessively about child-welfare authorities, molesting babysitters, and his own health. His child-rearing strategy swings between making his brother's upbringing manically fun and performing bizarre developmental experiments on him. (Case in point: his idea of suitable bedtime reading is John Hersey's Hiroshima.) The book is also, perhaps less successfully, about being young and hip and out to conquer the world (in an ironic, media-savvy, Gen-X way, naturally). In the early '90s, Eggers was one of the founders of the very funny Might Magazine, and he spends a fair amount of time here on Might, the hipster culture of San Francisco's South Park, and his own efforts to get on to MTV's Real World. This sort of thing doesn't age very well--but then, Eggers knows that. There's no criticism you can come up with that he hasn't put into A.H.W.O.S.G. already. ""The book thereafter is kind of uneven,"" he tells us regarding the contents after page 109, and while that's true, it's still uneven in a way that is funny and heartfelt and interesting. All this self-consciousness could have become unbearably arch. It's a testament to Eggers's skill as a writer--and to the heartbreaking particulars of his story--that it doesn't. Currently the editor of the footnote-and-marginalia-intensive journal McSweeney's (the last issue featured an entire story by David Foster Wallace printed tinily on its spine), Eggers comes from the most media-saturated generation in history--so much so that he can't feel an emotion without the sense that it's already been felt for him. What may seem like postmodern noodling is really just Eggers writing about pain in the only honest way available to him. Oddly enough, the effect is one of complete sincerity, and--especially in its concluding pages--this memoir as metafiction is affecting beyond all rational explanation. --Mary Park ...more",dave eggers is a terrifically talented writer don t hold his cleverness against him what to make of a book called a heartbreaking work of staggering genius based on a true story for starters there s a good bit of staggering genius before you even get to the true story including a preface a list of rules and suggestions for enjoyment of this book and a page ack dave eggers is a terrifically talented writer don t hold his cleverness against him what to make of a book called a heartbreaking work of staggering genius based on a true story for starters there s a good bit of staggering genius before you even get to the true story including a preface a list of rules and suggestions for enjoyment of this book and a page acknowledgements section complete with special mail in offer flow chart of the book s themes and a lovely pen and ink drawing of a stapler helpfully labeled here is a drawing of a stapler but on to the true story at the age of eggers became both an orphan and a single mother when his parents died within five months of one another of unrelated cancers in the ensuing sibling division of labor dave is appointed unofficial guardian of his year old brother christopher the two live together in semi squalor decaying food and sports equipment scattered about while eggers worries obsessively about child welfare authorities molesting babysitters and his own health his child rearing strategy swings between making his brother s upbringing manically fun and performing bizarre developmental experiments on him case in point his idea of suitable bedtime reading is john hersey s hiroshima the book is also perhaps less successfully about being young and hip and out to conquer the world in an ironic media savvy gen x way naturally in the early s eggers was one of the founders of the very funny might magazine and he spends a fair amount of time here on might the hipster culture of san francisco s south park and his own efforts to get on to mtv s real world this sort of thing doesn t age very well but then eggers knows that there s no criticism you can come up with that he hasn t put into a h w o s g already the book thereafter is kind of uneven he tells us regarding the contents after page and while that s true it s still uneven in a way that is funny and heartfelt and interesting all this self consciousness could have become unbearably arch it s a testament to eggers s skill as a writer and to the heartbreaking particulars of his story that it doesn t currently the editor of the footnote and marginalia intensive journal mcsweeney s the last issue featured an entire story by david foster wallace printed tinily on its spine eggers comes from the most media saturated generation in history so much so that he can t feel an emotion without the sense that it s already been felt for him what may seem like postmodern noodling is really just eggers writing about pain in the only honest way available to him oddly enough the effect is one of complete sincerity and especially in its concluding pages this memoir as metafiction is affecting beyond all rational explanation mary park more,Dave Eggers

We feel love for our companions, certainly, and happiness at the thought that we’re providing them with a safe, healthy life. But there’s another emotion, less often acknowledged, that can be nearly as powerful: guilt. When we see our cats gazing wistfully out the window, or watch a goldfish swim lazy circles in a bowl, we can’t help but wonder: are we doing the right thing, keeping these independent beings locked up, subject to our control? Is keeping pets actually good for the pets themselves?   That’s the question that animates Jessica Pierce’s powerful Run, Spot, Run. A lover of pets herself (including, over the years, dogs, cats, fish, rats, hermit crabs, and more), Pierce understands the joys that pets bring us. But she also refuses to deny the ambiguous ethics at the heart of the relationship, and through a mix of personal stories, philosophical reflections, and scientifically informed analyses of animal behavior and natural history, she puts pet-keeping to the test. Is it ethical to keep pets at all? Are some species more suited to the relationship than others? Are there species one should never attempt to own? And are there ways that we can improve our pets’ lives, so that we can be confident that we are giving them as much as they give us?   Deeply empathetic, yet rigorous and unflinching in her thinking, Pierce has written a book that is sure to help any pet owner, unsettling assumptions but also giving them the knowledge to build deeper, better relationships with the animals with whom they’ve chosen to share their lives. ...more",a life shared with pets brings many emotions we feel love for our companions certainly and happiness at the thought that we re providing them with a safe healthy life but there s another emotion less often acknowledged that can be nearly as powerful guilt when we see our cats gazing wistfully out the window or watch a goldfish swim lazy circles in a bowl we can a life shared with pets brings many emotions we feel love for our companions certainly and happiness at the thought that we re providing them with a safe healthy life but there s another emotion less often acknowledged that can be nearly as powerful guilt when we see our cats gazing wistfully out the window or watch a goldfish swim lazy circles in a bowl we can t help but wonder are we doing the right thing keeping these independent beings locked up subject to our control is keeping pets actually good for the pets themselves that s the question that animates jessica pierce s powerful run spot run a lover of pets herself including over the years dogs cats fish rats hermit crabs and more pierce understands the joys that pets bring us but she also refuses to deny the ambiguous ethics at the heart of the relationship and through a mix of personal stories philosophical reflections and scientifically informed analyses of animal behavior and natural history she puts pet keeping to the test is it ethical to keep pets at all are some species more suited to the relationship than others are there species one should never attempt to own and are there ways that we can improve our pets lives so that we can be confident that we are giving them as much as they give us deeply empathetic yet rigorous and unflinching in her thinking pierce has written a book that is sure to help any pet owner unsettling assumptions but also giving them the knowledge to build deeper better relationships with the animals with whom they ve chosen to share their lives more,Unknown

To reassure himself, he set out on a voyage of rediscovery of the American identity, accompanied by a distinguished French poodle named Charley; and riding in a three-quarter-ton pickup truck named Rocinante.   His course took him through almost forty states: northward from Long Island to Maine; through the Midwest to Chicago; onward by way of Minnesota, North Dakota, Montana (with which he fell in love), and Idaho to Seattle, south to San Francisco and his birthplace, Salinas; eastward through the Mojave, New Mexico, Arizona, to the vast hospitality of Texas, to New Orleans and a shocking drama of desegregation; finally, on the last leg, through Alabama, Virginia, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey to New York.  Travels with Charley in Search of America is an intimate look at one of America's most beloved writers in the later years of his life—a self-portrait of a man who never wrote an explicit autobiography. Written during a time of upheaval and racial tension in the South—which Steinbeck witnessed firsthand—Travels with Charley is a stunning evocation of America on the eve of a tumultuous decade.  ...more",an intimate journey across and in search of america as told by one of its most beloved writers in a deluxe centennial edition in september john steinbeck embarked on a journey across america he felt that he might have lost touch with the country with its speech the smell of its grass and trees its color and quality of light the pulse of its people to reassure an intimate journey across and in search of america as told by one of its most beloved writers in a deluxe centennial edition in september john steinbeck embarked on a journey across america he felt that he might have lost touch with the country with its speech the smell of its grass and trees its color and quality of light the pulse of its people to reassure himself he set out on a voyage of rediscovery of the american identity accompanied by a distinguished french poodle named charley and riding in a three quarter ton pickup truck named rocinante his course took him through almost forty states northward from long island to maine through the midwest to chicago onward by way of minnesota north dakota montana with which he fell in love and idaho to seattle south to san francisco and his birthplace salinas eastward through the mojave new mexico arizona to the vast hospitality of texas to new orleans and a shocking drama of desegregation finally on the last leg through alabama virginia pennsylvania and new jersey to new york travels with charley in search of america is an intimate look at one of america s most beloved writers in the later years of his life a self portrait of a man who never wrote an explicit autobiography written during a time of upheaval and racial tension in the south which steinbeck witnessed firsthand travels with charley is a stunning evocation of america on the eve of a tumultuous decade more,john steinbeck

The rest of the story concerns Dream's quest to recover his totems of power, which were dispersed following his capture: a pouch of sand, a helm and a ruby. The pouch is being kept by a former girlfriend of John Constantine's. Once that is recovered, Dream travels to hell to regain the helm from a demon, where he incurs the wrath of Lucifer (an enmity that will have major repercussions later in the series).

Here, one of the great modern translators presents us with The Odyssey, Homer's best-loved poem, recounting Odysseus' wanderings after the Trojan War. With wit and wile, the 'man of twists and turns' meets the challenges of the sea-god Poseidon, and monsters ranging from the many-headed Scylla to the cannibalistic Cyclops Polyphemus - only to return after twenty years to a home besieged by his wife Penelope's suitors. In the myths and legends retold in this immortal poem, Fagles has captured the energy of Homer's original in a bold, contemporary idiom.Seven greek cities claim the honour of being the birthplace of Homer (c. 8th-7th century BC), the poet to whom the composition of the Iliad and Odyssey are attributed. The Iliad is the oldest surviving work of Western literature, but the identity - or even the existence - of Homer himself is a complete mystery, with no reliable biographical information having survived.If you enjoyed The Odyssey, you might like Robert Fagles' translation of The Iliad, also available in Penguin Classics.'Wonderfully readable ...

After four years of collaboration, they produced an incisive account of their idea of Communism, in which they envisage a society without classes, private property or a state, arguing that the exploitation of industrial workers will eventually lead to a revolution in which Capitalism is overthrown. This vision provided the theoretical basis of political systems in Russia, China, Cuba and Eastern Europe, affecting the lives of millions.

As dystopian stories like Hunger Games and Battle Royale surge in popularity, this haunting tale of a group of young boys stranded on a desert island still captivates schoolchildren around the world, raising timeless and profound questions about how easily society can slip into chaos and savagery when rules and order have been abandoned.When a plane crashes on a remote island, a small group of schoolboys are the sole survivors. From the prophetic Simon and virtuous Ralph to the lovable Piggy and brutish Jack, each of the boys attempts to establish control as the reality- and brutal savagery-of their situation sets in.A teacher himself, Golding clearly understood how to interest children with a gripping story and strong, sympathetic characters. The novel serves as a catalyst for thought-provoking discussion and analysis of universal issues, not only concerning the capabilities of humans for good and evil and the fragility of moral inhibition, but beyond.The boys' struggle to find a way of existing in a community with no fixed boundaries invites readers to evaluate the concepts involved in social and political constructs and moral frameworks. Symbolism is strong throughout, revealing both the boys' capacity for empathy and hope, as well as illuminating the darkest corners of the human spirit. Ideas of community, leadership, and the rule of law are called into question as the reader has to consider who has a right to power, why, and what the consequences of the acquisition of power may be.Often compared to Catcher in the Rye, Lord of the Flies also represents a coming-of-age story of innocence lost. ...more",since it was first published in william golding s classic debut novel has remained a stark allegory of civilization survival and human nature as dystopian stories like hunger games and battle royale surge in popularity this haunting tale of a group of young boys stranded on a desert island still captivates schoolchildren around the world raising timeless and pro since it was first published in william golding s classic debut novel has remained a stark allegory of civilization survival and human nature as dystopian stories like hunger games and battle royale surge in popularity this haunting tale of a group of young boys stranded on a desert island still captivates schoolchildren around the world raising timeless and profound questions about how easily society can slip into chaos and savagery when rules and order have been abandoned when a plane crashes on a remote island a small group of schoolboys are the sole survivors from the prophetic simon and virtuous ralph to the lovable piggy and brutish jack each of the boys attempts to establish control as the reality and brutal savagery of their situation sets in a teacher himself golding clearly understood how to interest children with a gripping story and strong sympathetic characters the novel serves as a catalyst for thought provoking discussion and analysis of universal issues not only concerning the capabilities of humans for good and evil and the fragility of moral inhibition but beyond the boys struggle to find a way of existing in a community with no fixed boundaries invites readers to evaluate the concepts involved in social and political constructs and moral frameworks symbolism is strong throughout revealing both the boys capacity for empathy and hope as well as illuminating the darkest corners of the human spirit ideas of community leadership and the rule of law are called into question as the reader has to consider who has a right to power why and what the consequences of the acquisition of power may be often compared to catcher in the rye lord of the flies also represents a coming of age story of innocence lost more,William Golding

Even more startling, more than thirty percent of those under the age of thirty now identify as ""Nones""--answering ""none"" when queried about their religious affiliation. Is America losing its religion? Or, as more and more Americans choose different spiritual paths, are they changing what it means to be religious in the United States today? In Choosing Our Religion, Elizabeth Drescher explores the diverse, complex spiritual lives of Nones across generations and across categories of self-identification as ""Spiritual-But-Not-Religious,"" ""Atheist,"" ""Agnostic,"" ""Humanist,"" ""just Spiritual,"" and more. Drawing on more than one hundred interviews conducted across the United States, Drescher opens a window into the lives of a broad cross-section of Nones, diverse with respect to age, gender, race, sexual orientation, and prior religious background. She allows Nones to speak eloquently for themselves, illuminating the processes by which they became None, the sources of information and inspiration that enrich their spiritual lives, the practices they find spiritually meaningful, how prayer functions in spiritual lives not centered on doctrinal belief, how morals and values are shaped outside of institutional religions, and how Nones approach the spiritual development of their own children.

None of the gritty darkness or frenzied action is lost in 1st to Die, although the female protagonists offer an even deeper emotional context to this suspense thriller.Inspector Lindsay Boxer of the San Francisco Police Department suddenly finds herself in the middle of two horrifying situations: The first is that she's just learned she has an often-fatal blood disease. The second is a double homicide case she is now heading up that involves the murder of newlyweds on their wedding night. Burdened with Chris Raleigh, a new partner reassigned from the mayor's office, Lindsay finds that she has too much to deal with and turns to her best friend, Claire, the head ME on the case. Claire offers helpful advice and human, friendly contact amid a job filled with violence, cruelty, and fear.Soon a fledgling newspaper reporter, Cindy, makes contact with Lindsay looking for a career-making story. Although Lindsay can't officially comment on the case, the two women form a rapport, and Cindy joins Lindsay and Claire for their weekly meeting. When a second pair of newlyweds is murdered, and later a third, the investigation leads to a prominent crime writer, Nicholas Jenks, who has a history of spousal abuse and a predilection for kinky, dangerous sex games. With the help of an understanding assistant D.A., Jill Bernhardt, Lindsay tries to make a case against Jenks, who even had an affair with one of the slain women. Eventually Jill joins the Murder Club, and the four ladies share private interdepartmental information in an effort to track and stop the killer before he strikes again.The major subplot -- Lindsay's facing up to her illness even while she learns to fall in love again -- carefully compensates for the novel's coarse scenes of brutality. Lindsay Boxer is't merely an obsessed cop trailing a maniac; she's also a terrified woman confronting the onslaught of disease. The story lines balance out to show us the true mettle of someone who puts the safety of others before her own.Again, Patterson's skill for producing furiously paced fiction are evident as the novel breezes by rapidly. The short chapters keep the narrative leaping with increasingly taut plot elements, but there's an emotional commitment that makes our protagonist even more amiable and involving. 1st to Die is a novel that works as an intense series of character portraits that will leave the reader touched and delighted.--Tom Piccirilli ...more",james patterson bestselling author of the alex cross novels along came a spider kiss the girls and pop goes the weasel offers the first of a new series dubbed the women s murder club featuring a four woman team that occasionally works outside the system none of the gritty darkness or frenzied action is lost in st to die although the female protagonists offer an eve james patterson bestselling author of the alex cross novels along came a spider kiss the girls and pop goes the weasel offers the first of a new series dubbed the women s murder club featuring a four woman team that occasionally works outside the system none of the gritty darkness or frenzied action is lost in st to die although the female protagonists offer an even deeper emotional context to this suspense thriller inspector lindsay boxer of the san francisco police department suddenly finds herself in the middle of two horrifying situations the first is that she s just learned she has an often fatal blood disease the second is a double homicide case she is now heading up that involves the murder of newlyweds on their wedding night burdened with chris raleigh a new partner reassigned from the mayor s office lindsay finds that she has too much to deal with and turns to her best friend claire the head me on the case claire offers helpful advice and human friendly contact amid a job filled with violence cruelty and fear soon a fledgling newspaper reporter cindy makes contact with lindsay looking for a career making story although lindsay can t officially comment on the case the two women form a rapport and cindy joins lindsay and claire for their weekly meeting when a second pair of newlyweds is murdered and later a third the investigation leads to a prominent crime writer nicholas jenks who has a history of spousal abuse and a predilection for kinky dangerous sex games with the help of an understanding assistant d a jill bernhardt lindsay tries to make a case against jenks who even had an affair with one of the slain women eventually jill joins the murder club and the four ladies share private interdepartmental information in an effort to track and stop the killer before he strikes again the major subplot lindsay s facing up to her illness even while she learns to fall in love again carefully compensates for the novel s coarse scenes of brutality lindsay boxer is t merely an obsessed cop trailing a maniac she s also a terrified woman confronting the onslaught of disease the story lines balance out to show us the true mettle of someone who puts the safety of others before her own again patterson s skill for producing furiously paced fiction are evident as the novel breezes by rapidly the short chapters keep the narrative leaping with increasingly taut plot elements but there s an emotional commitment that makes our protagonist even more amiable and involving st to die is a novel that works as an intense series of character portraits that will leave the reader touched and delighted tom piccirilli more,Unknown
